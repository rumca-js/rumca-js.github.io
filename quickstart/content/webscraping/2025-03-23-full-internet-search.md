So it happened. Finally. I finished the full internet offline search.

So what it is?

 - It's an internet search tool, designed to find domains on the web.
 - Itâ€™s offline, meaning all searches are performed directly on your device.
 - it uses JavaScript heresy
 - It utilizes SQLite to fetch data.
