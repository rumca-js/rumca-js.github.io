Today I have fixed a quite nasty bug in my hobby project.

Maybe it was easy to spot. Request from python requests was not closed after being made.

This lead to memory leak, which fortunately was detected by own "memory traps".

It's hard to develop project without some "contraints", "limits", that will be triggered and notify the mastah.

This also makes me more careful about python. It is full of traps. Exceptions are especially hard for me, when I have C++ background.

Most often I check return values. Now I need to be extra careful about exceptions, because if in exception handling something is not closed properly, then it is not closed at all.

You have to be carefull like a mine sweeper.
