There are many things wrong with the current web, I wanted to keep track of them.

You can disagree with some of them, but that may not indicate you are right.

 - your page does not provide valid meta fields. There is a lot of them. Title, description. There are og: fields, image thumbnails, og: publish date. There is also LD-JSON data, and other SEO keyword tags
 - your page is not bot friendly. I am not saying that the web page should provide data for free. I should be able to scrape some data about your site. Who are you, what you do. Etc. This will boost your visibility
 - main domain does not provide any index.html file. You main domain is your front door. It should cleanly, and clearly state what you site is about, and provide useful links
 - provide sitemap, if possible
 - provide valid robots.txt, to limit bots use
 - protecting data with 403 statuses, no data at all. Again, please take a look at YouTube. You cannot easily download video, but the meta is freely available on the page. It is just lying there for you to use
