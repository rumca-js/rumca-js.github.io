Recently I have been working on my scraping library [webtoolkit](https://github.com/rumca-js/webtoolkit).

To create it I had to extract code, simplify and streamline code.

After these operations my main project sources started working.

In summary: by simplifying code, cleaning API, you can fix problems. Unreadable code is prone to error.

It may be obvious, but too often we are lazy not to clean up APIs.
