(Hard Rock / Nu-Metal / Punk Fusion)

[Verse 1]
You type like a king on a plastic throne
With a smirk in your tone, throwing digital stones
Passive rage in your precious reply
You don’t listen — you just crucify

Ideas burn in the echo pit
Mob rules, and you’re proud of it
Labels fly like grenades in the mist
Leftist, incel — which one did I miss?

[Pre-Chorus]
Scroll down, it’s a battlefield
Truth dies when the likes are sealed
I tried to talk, tried to feel
But nuance is against the deal

[Chorus] (screamed)
🎤 I hate you!
You're a troll with a dopamine itch
I hate you!
Profit’s god, and anger’s the pitch
I hate you!
Mocked for standing in between
I hate you!
It’s red or blue — no room to dream

[Verse 2]
Cold screen, but the fire’s lit
Algorithm feeding every bit
You hate me? Good. That’s the bait.
You just boosted the engagement rate

I saw a thought — tried to explore
But they called me a gooner, queer, or a whore
Burn the bridge if I don’t comply
Say the wrong thing — they want me to die

[Pre-Chorus]
Keyboard gangs in their glory haze
They don’t think — they just paraphrase
Echoes from a foreign shore
Russian chaos knockin’ at the door

[Chorus] (roared louder)
🎤 I hate you!
You speak in sarcasm and pride
I hate you!
While the platforms pick a side
I hate you!
For the mobs that never rest
I hate you!
For the cage you call a “test”

[Bridge – spoken growl / breakdown style]
Don’t you dare be neutral — you’ll be erased
Fence-sitters get digitally displaced
It’s not debate — it’s a blood parade
Where likes are knives, and truth decays

(Heavy drop — drums, bass, distorted scream)
👊 They want us angry — it makes them rich
👊 They want us tribal — they flip the switch
👊 They show the hate, and hide the peace
👊 Divide and conquer — the hate won’t cease

[Final Chorus] (pure catharsis — shouted by crowd)
🎤 I hate you!
Not for who you are — but who you play
I hate you!
You’re a puppet in a war-for-pay
I hate you!
Because we’re lost in the fight
I hate you!
And the screen’s our goddamn light

[Outro – echoing scream into silence]
🔥 I HATE YOU!
…And that’s exactly what they want
