🎵 Brave Sir Robin of the Digital Glen 🎵
An Epic Folk Metal Ballad

[Verse 1]
Through silicon trees and fibered glades,
Where firewalls flicker and shadow wades,
There rode a knight of ancient code,
Sir Robin, feared on every node.

He bore the Lace of Hundred Deaths,
A threaded doom with whispered breaths.
His shield, a gift from cheated kings,
Could break the lies that malware brings.

[Chorus]
Brave Sir Robin! Of the digital glen!
Breaker of bugs and slayer of men!
With bytes as arrows and RAM as might,
He ruled the dark with blinding light!
All knew his name in hidden threads—
Where Robin walks, the brave turn red.

[Verse 2]
He knew each root, each backdoor trail,
The zero-days, the poisoned mail.
He’d speak in pings, his words would crash
The blackest lords in a cyber flash.

His fingers danced on ancient keys,
He summoned wrath on data seas.
Even the daemons dared not rise
When Robin’s gaze did digitize.

[Bridge – Mid-tempo folk riff with flute & distorted guitar harmony]
(Digital pulses echo like war drums as synth-strings build tension)
But oh, brave knight, what cursed fate—
The end would come, so silent, late...

[Verse 3 – Slower, somber tone]
His steed, the mighty PC’s core,
Did spark and flicker, then no more.
Its fan fell still, its screen turned black,
And Robin vanished, left no track.

The forest wept in copper streams,
The networks mourned their shattered dreams.
The glen grew cold, the night drew near—
No more would Robin's boots appear.

[Chorus – slower and haunting]
Brave Sir Robin... where did you go?
Lost in code or overflow?
The woods remember, the data sighs,
A legend etched in endless bytes.

[Final Chorus – triumphant and fast]
But listen close, in tempest's moan,
His code still walks when you're alone!
Brave Sir Robin, ghost in the drive—
He rides again when hacks survive!

[Outro – slow lute fading to silence]
And when the woods begin to hum,
Sir Robin's time has yet to come.
The lace still waits in shadowed breath—
A hundred deaths… and none are death.

🎵 Brave Sir Robin Surfed the Net 🎵
(To be sung with a lute, kazoo, or badly sampled 8-bit MIDI)

[Verse 1]
Brave Sir Robin surfed the net,
Through digital woods so dark and wet!
He cracked all locks, he crushed all threats,
He never once got spam!

His code was strong, his scripts were sleek,
His firewalls sang in ancient Greek,
And every foe would shriek and freak,
When Robin took command!

[Chorus]
🎶 Bravely ran the packets of Sir Robin! 🎶
🎶 Bravely, boldly ran his code! 🎶
🎶 He had a mighty Lace of Death!
🎶 It choked all files and stole their breath!
🎶 A hundred threads that fried your RAM,
🎶 And crashed your mom’s exam!

[Verse 2]
He bore a shield, cheat-proof and bright,
It bounced back hacks with pixel light!
He never lagged, he never froze,
He debugged trolls with stylish prose.

He knew each port, each worm, each breach,
He even made the daemons screech!
And when he walked, the servers bowed—
Sir Robin stood both brave and proud!

[Bridge – spoken, bard-style]
🎙️ He once unzipped a cursed .exe with only his pinky finger...
🎙️ He made Clippy weep and Bing implode!
🎙️ He turned a CAPTCHA into a haiku!

[Verse 3 – somber tone]
But then… oh woe! His steed did die—
His PC let out one last sigh.
Its fans went still, its light grew dim,
It slipped away… deleting him.

No BIOS beep, no final ping,
Just silence in the cyber-ring.
He vanished deep in ghostly code,
A 404 on every road.

[Chorus – mournful, yet heroic]
🎶 Bravely did Sir Robin vanish! 🎶
🎶 Into bits and byte decay! 🎶
🎶 No more shall his mouse click thunder,
🎶 Nor his macros bring down plunder!
🎶 But in the woods, his spirit dwells—
🎶 In cursed links and faulty shells!

[Outro – upbeat again, with flute and dramatic kazoo]
So raise a toast to digital glen,
To brave Sir Robin, lord of men!
He may be gone, but rest assured—
His memes remain, forever stored!
