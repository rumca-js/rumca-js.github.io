🎸 Guardians of the Thread ⚖️
(Genre: Power Metal / Heroic Epic)

[Intro – Heroic Instrumental with soaring guitars and double-kick drums]

[Verse 1]
I stand alone on the Bridge of Truth,
Where trolls descend and twist the youth.
My banner raised, my sword in hand,
I hold the line, I make my stand.

The rules are sacred, forged in fire,
With duty burning like a choir.
From the shadows, chaos calls—
But I will stand when justice falls!

[Pre-Chorus]
Flames may rise and darkness swell,
But I’ll send them back to where they dwell!

[Chorus – Soaring and powerful]
My mission is to protect the users!
No bot, no spammer, no deceiver shall pass!
I fight for truth! I fight for the subreddit!
In the halls of honor, I raise my banhammer!
We are the watchers, forever unfazed—
Guardians of the thread, lighting the blaze!

[Verse 2]
They test the walls with twisted words,
Incite with gifs, insult in herds.
But I’ve seen chaos, I’ve seen hate—
And I won’t let it seal our fate.

In every tag, in every post,
We fight not for pride, but what matters most.
Free speech and reason, side by side—
With modmail shields, we turn the tide!

[Pre-Chorus]
Through downvote storms, I hear the cry—
"Mod, stand tall—don’t let truth die!"

[Chorus – Even more epic, with harmonized backing vocals]
My mission is to protect the users!
No troll, no scam, no dark intent shall last!
I fight for truth! I fight for the subreddit!
In the fire of flags, I cast the final verdict!
We are the sentries, the gatekeepers brave—
Guardians of the thread, no soul to enslave!

[Bridge – Instrumental Duel: Keyboard vs Guitar]

Solo winds like a rising flame—
Justice carved into the name.
In the digital realm, we rise, we roar—
The silent knights of internet lore.

[Final Chorus – Key change, triumphant]
My mission is to protect the users!
With shield of rules and heart ablaze with light!
I fight for truth! I fight for the subreddit!
Until the last report, I stand and fight!
 We are the guardians, sworn and true—
For every reader, we fight for you!

[Outro – Spoken, over fading guitar]
So next time you scroll and feel no fear…
Know that a mod was standing near.
