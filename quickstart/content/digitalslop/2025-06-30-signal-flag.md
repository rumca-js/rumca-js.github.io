“Echoes in the Rainbow”

rock

(Intro – soft keys with vinyl crackle)
Yeah…
That rainbow’s bright, but shadows lurk…
Listen close.

(Verse 1)

He waves that rainbow, colors so bright,
Pride on his sleeve, fightin’ day and night.
Profile lit up with love and hope,
But behind the screen, he’s barely cope.

Argues online, every thread’s a war,
Echo chambers shouting, can’t hear no more.
Harassed a stranger just ‘cause they don’t agree,
Swatted a man over some online plea.

He’s unhappy, but don’t know why,
Lost in the pixels, under neon sky.

(Hook)

Rainbow flag high, but the heart’s in chains,
Loud in the crowd but drowning in rains.
Silencing voices that don’t align,
Trapped in a world that’s lost the shine.
Blind to the truth, lost in the show,
Wavin’ the colors but nowhere to go.

(Verse 2)

Eyes on the screen, fed news like pills,
Whatever the feed says — that’s what he feels.
Can’t debate, can’t bend, no room to speak,
If you disagree, you’re labeled “weak.”

His echo chamber’s a glassy cage,
Mirroring hate, page after page.
Claims it’s for love, but love’s on pause,
No room for reason, just his cause.

(Hook)

Rainbow flag high, but the heart’s in chains,
Loud in the crowd but drowning in rains.
Silencing voices that don’t align,
Trapped in a world that’s lost the shine.
Blind to the truth, lost in the show,
Wavin’ the colors but nowhere to go.
(Bridge – softer, reflective)

The flag’s a symbol, pure and bright,
But when it’s used to start the fight,
What’s left behind? What’s left to heal?
Can love survive when no one’s real?

(Final Verse)

Now he scrolls through empty feeds,
Friends gone quiet, lost their needs.
Still waves the rainbow, still shouts loud,
A lonely soul beneath the crowd.

Is it pride if it comes with rage?
Is it love if you lock the cage?
If justice means only your side wins,
Then where do we bury all these sins?

(Final Hook)

Rainbow flag high, but the heart’s in chains,
Loud in the crowd but drowning in rains.
Silencing voices that don’t align,
Trapped in a world that’s lost the shine.
Blind to the truth, lost in the show,
Wavin’ the colors but nowhere to go.
