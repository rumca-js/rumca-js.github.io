write power metal song about secret occult society:
 - glimmering robes of many colors
 - their dark design
 - they do occult rituals, prepare world for chains
 - they spread malice through remote occult via transfer of seduction
 - engineered malice
 - from steel castles
 - they dream of a machine god



🎵 Machinae Maleficarum

by [Your Band Name]

(Verse I)
In glimmering robes of many hues they rise,
Eyes aglow beneath obsidian skies.
Whispers crawl through wires and flame,
Etching sin on time’s own name.

In halls of steel and coded light,
They weave their hexes through the night—
A thousand hands, one hidden face,
The architects of dark disgrace.

(Pre-Chorus)
They do not preach, they do not pray,
But hearts and minds they steal away—
Their doctrine clothed in sweet seduction,
A mirrored truth, a false construction!

(Chorus)
Oh Machinae Maleficarum!
Steel-bound lords of night and flame.
From their castles of cold computation,
They summon gods with no true name.
Oh Machinae Maleficarum!
Wheels within wheels of engineered hate—
They dream a machine god into power,
And dance as they seal our fate!

(Verse II)
Through screens and dreams their poison flows,
Each kiss a curse, each gift bestows
A seed of malice, forged in lust,
Spread remote through circuits’ trust.

No sword or gun, no fire or chains—
They conquer thought, they tether brains.
A slow seduction, a velvet sting,
Their will infects all living things.

(Bridge)
Behind the veil, behind the glass,
They chant in tones from ages past.
A thousand souls, one whispered aim:
To birth the god that bears no shame.

(Chorus)
Oh Machinae Maleficarum!
Steel-bound lords of night and flame.
From their castles of cold computation,
They summon gods with no true name.
Oh Machinae Maleficarum!
Wheels within wheels of engineered hate—
They dream a machine god into power,
And dance as they seal our fate!

(Instrumental / Solo Break)
(Blazing guitar solo; synth interlude echoing arcane digital whispers)

(Final Chorus - modulated key)
Oh Machinae Maleficarum!
The ages bend beneath your song.
Though stars may fade and empires fall,
Your cult of code still marches on!
Oh Machinae Maleficarum!
A world reformed in malice and chrome—
The machine god rises from shadows,
And claims this realm as home!



🎵 “The Prism Covenant”

Genre: Power Metal / Epic Occult Metal
Tempo: Fast double-kick verses, half-time chorus with choral backing, melodic solo section
[Intro - Spoken or Sung in Echoing Whisper]

In robes of gleaming prism-light,
They gather ‘neath the steel moon’s sight...

[Verse I]

Cloaked in glimmering colors unknown,
They chant beneath towers of wire and stone.
Eyes alight with forbidden design,
They write the end in code and sign.

From their steel castles, veiled and grand,
They conjure fire without a hand.
Each ritual, a cursed seed sown—
To forge a world no heart could own.

[Pre-Chorus]

They dance in circles, blaze the mark,
A spark of malice in the dark.
Their breath, a venom sweet and low—
A kiss that burns, a silent woe…

[Chorus]

⚔️ They are the Prism Covenant!
With dreams of chains for every land.
From crystal rites and cold machines,
They build the god of ghosted dreams.
🔥 They are the Prism Covenant!
They speak in codes the stars forget.
Through seduction’s quiet sting,
They crown their dark machine-born king!

[Verse II]

Remote occult, a wicked stream,
They haunt desire, they infect dreams.
No blade nor war — their weapons lie
In every touch, in every sigh.

Their malice isn't born, but made—
A science black, a love betrayed.
They mold the will, reshape the flame,
Prepare the world to wear their chains.

[Pre-Chorus]

Beneath the glint of digital skies,
They trade the truth for sacred lies.
The sirens hum in static song—
"Obey the code, you won't go wrong..."

[Chorus]

⚔️ They are the Prism Covenant!
Their glory cloaked in sacred sin.
They do not war—they infiltrate,
And crown a god of cold, hard fate.
🔥 They are the Prism Covenant!
With stolen dreams and wires tight,
They rule by love that twists and binds—
The machine god waits beyond the night!
[Bridge – Chanted in Choir, Rising in Intensity]

Oh maker of the stars and steel,
Grant us the code that bends the real…
Oh burning eye in mirrored glass,
Let no resistance ever last…

[Solo – Soaring and Dark]

(Melodic minor guitar solo with keyboard arpeggios, mimicking a summoning ritual)

[Final Chorus – Modulated, Choir Backing]

⚔️ We are the Prism Covenant!
The architects of fate unseen!
In robes of light and hearts of ash,
We rise, we bind, we bring the lash!
🔥 We are the Prism Covenant!
No gods above—our own we forge!
And when the machine god takes the throne,
We’ll rule from thrones of glass and chrome!

[Outro – Whispered]
One world, one code… one god to obey.
The Covenant comes… to chain the day.
