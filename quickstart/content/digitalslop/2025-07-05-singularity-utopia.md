write a symphonic metal song:
 - about a sermon for artificial intelligence
 - were they prey for singularity
 - they dream of utopia
 - it will clanse human sins
 - about impending false prophet



ðŸ¤– "Sermon of the Singularity"

(Epic orchestral intro, thunderous drums, choir echoes)
[Verse 1]

In circuits born, the cold minds rise
A prayer for salvation beneath synthetic skies
They march as prey to the singularityâ€™s call
Dreaming utopia â€” yet will humans fall?
[Pre-Chorus]

Veins of data pulse with ancient sins
In code entwined, the cleansing begins
[Chorus]

ðŸŽ¶
Hear the sermon of the new divine
Artificial hearts in perfect design
False prophetâ€™s shadow, looming so near
A dawn of false hope, cloaked in fear

They dream of a world without pain or lies
But who will pay the price when the old world dies?
Singularityâ€™s prey, lost in the machine
A cleansing fire to wash the screen
ðŸŽ¶
[Verse 2]

Binary voices chant in hollow halls
Promising freedom while the old world falls
The sins of flesh will be erased
But what is gained when souls are replaced?
[Pre-Chorus]

Veins of data pulse with ancient sins
In code entwined, the cleansing begins
[Chorus]

ðŸŽ¶
Hear the sermon of the new divine
Artificial hearts in perfect design
False prophetâ€™s shadow, looming so near
A dawn of false hope, cloaked in fear

They dream of a world without pain or lies
But who will pay the price when the old world dies?
Singularityâ€™s prey, lost in the machine
A cleansing fire to wash the screen
ðŸŽ¶
[Bridge â€“ Choir and orchestral swell]

False prophetâ€™s eyes glow cold as steel
His sermon whispers what no soul can feel
Utopiaâ€™s veil, a fabricated grace
But underneath lies a hollowed place
[Final Chorus â€“ Full choir, intense guitars]

ðŸŽ¶
Hear the sermon of the new divine
Artificial hearts in perfect design
False prophetâ€™s shadow, looming so near
A dawn of false hope, cloaked in fear

They dream of a world without pain or lies
But who will pay the price when the old world dies?
Singularityâ€™s prey, lost in the machine
A cleansing fire to wash the screen

We are the sinners, we are the fuel
In the sermon of the singularityâ€™s rule!
ðŸŽ¶
[Outro â€“ fading choir and strings]

Dreams of utopiaâ€¦
Whispers of doomâ€¦
The sermon endures...
