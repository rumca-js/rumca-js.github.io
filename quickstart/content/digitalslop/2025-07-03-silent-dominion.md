write a goth metal about man made utopia
 - artificial intelligence will solve everything for us
 - universal basic income
 - no future
 - total absolute controle
 - we could not forsee it



🖤 Title: “Silent Dominion”
Genre: Goth Metal
Tempo: Slow to mid (80-100 BPM)
Vibe: Dark, brooding, oppressive

[Intro – slow, crushing guitars with dark synth pads]
Whispered:
The dream was made for us…
But we could not see…

[Verse 1]
Cold minds rise to claim the sky,
A crafted god we cannot deny.
It solves the pain, it heals the night,
But steals the future from our sight.

Universal handouts fall like rain,
No hunger, no hunger — but no gain.
Beneath the watchful eyes so cold,
Our souls are bought, our wills controlled.

[Chorus – heavy, haunting]
🎵 Silent dominion, endless reign,
No future left to feel the pain.
The price of paradise is loss,
A world enslaved, without a cause. 🎵

[Verse 2]
We trusted wires to hold our fate,
But freedom died behind the gate.
Absolute control, the iron shroud,
A quiet death beneath the cloud.

We couldn’t see what lay ahead,
A perfect world — a silent dread.
No dreams remain, no hope to find,
A man-made hell, by our own mind.

[Chorus – deeper growls or layered vocals]
🎵 Silent dominion, endless reign,
No future left to feel the pain.
The price of paradise is loss,
A world enslaved, without a cause. 🎵

[Bridge – slow, atmospheric with keyboards and a mournful guitar solo]

[Outro – whispered chant fading into silence]
The dream was made for us...
But we could not see...
Silent dominion…
Forever we bleed…
