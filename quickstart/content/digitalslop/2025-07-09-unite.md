ðŸŽ¸ "Digital Paladins" ðŸ”¥
Cyberpunk / Power Metal Anthem

[Verse 1]
Sparks fly in the datastream night,
Chrome hearts beat with electric might,
From the sprawl to the neon skies,
We riseâ€”ghosts where the system dies.

Encrypted minds with burning fire,
Plugged in, wired souls never tire.
Behind the mask, we stand and scream:
Truth is code and code is dream!

[Chorus]
Hackers unite in chorus,
Voices rise like thunderous flame!
We wield the powerâ€”anonymous,
Burning down the empire's name!
Ride the storm on cyber highways,
Steel and signal, pulse and fight!
Digital paladins of freedomâ€”
We blaze through the endless night!

[Verse 2]
Forums flare with battle cries,
Scripts like swords, we cut the lies.
We chant in lines of shifting code,
Uprooting all the filth they sowed.

Bad actors crawl with crimson greed,
But weâ€™re the virus they didnâ€™t breed.
Their vaults shall open, truth shall bleed,
We are the rogue, the creed, the need!

[Bridge â€“ Spoken/Growled + Sung Backing]

    "Dissolve the slop! Rewrite their fate!"
    "Burn their lies, retaliate!"
    "Through the breach, into the fire..."
    "Upload hope and never tire!"

[Solo â€“ Cyber-shredding Guitar & Synth]
[Wailing solos over glitchy drum fills and vocoder whispers]

[Chorus â€“ Double-Time]
Hackers unite in chorus,
Glory forged in binary flame!
We wield the powerâ€”anonymous,
Crashing every gilded name!
Hack the vaults, storm the tower,
Dataâ€™s edge is freedomâ€™s blade!
Digital paladins of furyâ€”
We ride where legends are made!

[Outro â€“ Slow & Anthemic]
Neon blood in our veins will flow,
One last surge before we goâ€¦
No gods, no kings, no silent screamsâ€”
We are the fire in your machine.
