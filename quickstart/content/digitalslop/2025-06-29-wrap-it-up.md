[Verse 1]
I remember the days,
When I could send a pic, be free, no haze.
No eyes watchin’ from the screen,
No towers fallin’ in the scene.
Back when email felt sincere,
And freedom wasn’t laced with fear.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Call it the Patriot Act.
Eyes wide open, facts abstract—
Now they scan every move, every chat.

[Verse 2]
I need to see what you write,
Every message, every byte.
Let me scan, let me store,
Every thought behind your door.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Name it Child Safety Act.
Tell the public, “It's for kids,”
Then trade their rights for fibs.

[Verse 3]
Protect the children, yeah, that’s the pitch,
While privacy falls into a ditch.
What’s more sacred than the youth?
That’s how they disguise the truth.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Cyber Safety, that's the trap.
You like me now?
We’re all suspects on the map.

[Verse 4]
You a threat, I’m a threat—
Where’s your bomb? Where’s your net?
Better show some ID quick,
Or you ain’t browsing, not one click.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Encryption’s under attack.
No code too tight, no data black,
They want the keys, they want it back.

[Verse 5]
Need an ID? Better comply.
Without it, memes just pass you by.
No log-in, no access pass,
No freedom in this data class.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Terms of Use got you tagged.
Email, shoe size, DNA swag—
We track you now... uh, I mean "flag."

[Outro – Spoken Word Vibe]
Security they say...
But freedom don’t come wrapped in flags or fear.
It comes raw. It comes clear.
They wrapping it up—
But we see through the seal.



writ a hip-hop song about how government introduces new bills:
 - to protect people / users
 - child safety act is used to protect children, but also to track people
 - patriot act used to protect people, but also to track people
 - use other examples
 - chorus "Wrap it up, wrap it up"

🎵 Title: "Wrap It Up"

[Intro – Spoken]
Yeah...
They say it's for our safety...
But every law got a layer underneath.
Let's talk about it.

[Verse 1]
They draft it in the chamber, say it's for the greater good,
Another hundred pages, barely understood.
Child Safety Act — for the kids, that’s the claim,
But in the fine print, they track every name.

From the playgrounds to the broadband stream,
Cameras on the corners, know what your texts mean.
Say it's all love, but it’s more like a net,
Catchin' everybody — not just the threat.

[Chorus – Repeated]
Wrap it up, wrap it up — call it protection,
But it’s wrapped in layers of hidden inspection.
Wrap it up, wrap it up — they vote with pride,
But freedom takes a hit every time they decide.

[Verse 2]
Patriot Act — post-9/11 vibes,
"Protect the homeland," but it spies on lives.
Wiretaps rollin', no warrant in sight,
All in the dark, but they call it the light.

FISA courts — secret rubber-stamp kings,
Make surveillance legal with invisible strings.
Say it’s for the terror, the danger, the plot,
But they monitor your mom's Google search a lot.

[Chorus – Repeated]
Wrap it up, wrap it up — call it defense,
But the bill got a clause that don’t make no sense.
Wrap it up, wrap it up — they smile on cam,
While they quietly pass a domestic scan.

[Verse 3]
Protecting Kids Online Act — noble aim,
But metadata tags every IP name.
EARN IT Act — fight abuse, that’s the face,
But end-to-end encryption might get erased.

CLOUD Act — cross-border data requests,
Privacy's a puzzle, they just guess what’s best.
AI laws droppin’, facial rec in the mall,
Your rights shrink small when that gavel falls.

[Bridge – Slow & Reflective]
We want the safety, we want the peace,
But not at the cost of freedom's lease.
Bills stack up, but who reads through?
What's signed for the many might monitor you...

[Final Chorus – Extended]
Wrap it up, wrap it up — they seal it tight,
Said it’s for the kids, now they see your nightlight.
Wrap it up, wrap it up — keep the law clean,
But what’s hidden in the clause? A surveillance machine.

Wrap it up, wrap it up — we want that shield,
But not if our whole life gets revealed.
Wrap it up, wrap it up — yeah, sound that bell,
Read between the lines of the stories they tell...

[Outro – Spoken]
Next time they say it's "just to keep you safe"...
Ask what they're really wrapping inside that tape.
