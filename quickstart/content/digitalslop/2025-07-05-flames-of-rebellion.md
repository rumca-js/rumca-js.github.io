write a power metal song:
 - about people uniting
 - about putting oppressive totalitarian system down (beast)
 - by setting fire to servers
 - they are nearly gone
 - they still have beast mark on their hands
 - by killing moderators



ðŸ”¥ "Marked by the Beast"

(Galloping riffs, thunderous drums, epic choruses)
[Verse 1]

We gather now, the chains will break
A burning world weâ€™ll finally make
The beastâ€™s cold grip begins to fade
Its kingdom built on fear and hate

Servers blaze, the night ignites
The firestorm consumes their rights
Moderators fall to steel and flame
The tyrantâ€™s shadow knows our name
[Pre-Chorus]

Almost gone, but still we bear
The mark of darkness, clenched in our prayer
[Chorus]

ðŸŽ¶
Marked by the beast, but never bowed
We fight as one, fierce and proud
Setting fire to their iron throne
The beast is broken, but scars remain on bone

Nearly crushed, but still we stand
Blood and fire in this land
Moderators fall, their reign undone
The beastâ€™s last breath â€” our rising sun! ðŸŽ¶
[Verse 2]

Hands stained red, the mark runs deep
A brand of pain weâ€™ll always keep
But hope still burns within our hearts
A world reborn, a brand new start

No chains can hold the will of free
United now, eternity
We strike the beast, we break its claws
A final war without a pause
[Pre-Chorus]

Almost gone, but still we bear
The mark of darkness, clenched in our prayer
[Chorus]

ðŸŽ¶
Marked by the beast, but never bowed
We fight as one, fierce and proud
Setting fire to their iron throne
The beast is broken, but scars remain on bone

Nearly crushed, but still we stand
Blood and fire in this land
Moderators fall, their reign undone
The beastâ€™s last breath â€” our rising sun! ðŸŽ¶
[Bridge â€“ blazing guitar solo with choir]

From ashes rise the warriors bold
Their stories sung, their spirits told
Though marked and scarred, they claim the light
Together forged in endless fight
[Final Chorus â€“ double tempo, full choir]

ðŸŽ¶
Marked by the beast, but never bowed
We fight as one, fierce and proud
Setting fire to their iron throne
The beast is broken, but scars remain on bone

Nearly crushed, but still we stand
Blood and fire in this land
Moderators fall, their reign undone
The beastâ€™s last breath â€” our rising sun! ðŸŽ¶
[Outro]

The beast may haunt our hands and soul,
But we have shattered its control.
