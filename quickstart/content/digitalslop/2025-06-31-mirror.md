Title: Scroll Syndrome
hip-hop

(Chorus)
Scrollin’ all day, shame on me, I’m caught,
Filter on my face but the real’s forgot.
Pin that perfect pic, flex the fake vibe,
Algorithm loves the shallow tribe.

Stress pushups, gym, makeup game tight,
Hidin’ all the pain, showin’ only light.
Only good genes climb, that’s the code,
But the real stories? Man, they’re never told.

(Verse 1)
Click, snap, pose — it’s all for the feed,
Showin’ off a mask, not the truth we bleed.
No tears, no struggle, just smiles that stun,
Work hard behind the scenes but it’s never shown.

Algorithm’s queen, boosting the fake,
Likes for the shallow, while deep ones break.
Stress pushups in the morning, makeup at night,
Hidin’ every flaw, but it ain’t right.

(Pre-Chorus)
Swipe, scroll, trapped in the loop,
Can’t stop the feed, I’m jumpin’ through hoops.
Shame on me, lost in this game,
Craving real but I’m chasing fame.

(Chorus)
Scrollin’ all day, shame on me, I’m caught,
Filter on my face but the real’s forgot.
Pin that perfect pic, flex the fake vibe,
Algorithm loves the shallow tribe.

Stress pushups, gym, makeup game tight,
Hidin’ all the pain, showin’ only light.
Only good genes climb, that’s the code,
But the real stories? Man, they’re never told.

(Verse 2)
Face in the screen, it’s a highlight reel,
No sweat, no scars, just a polished deal.
Hard work’s invisible, struggles denied,
Only the flawless get pushed worldwide.

Fake personas rise, real ones fade,
Algorithm’s got us all in its shade.
Scrollin’ nonstop, I’m caught in the spin,
Shame on me for fallin’ for the grin.

(Bridge)
Can’t break free, this digital haze,
Lost in the glow of the perfect gaze.
Want real vibes but the screen’s too bright,
Caught in the trap of the shallow light.

(Chorus)
Scrollin’ all day, shame on me, I’m caught,
Filter on my face but the real’s forgot.
Pin that perfect pic, flex the fake vibe,
Algorithm loves the shallow tribe.

Stress pushups, gym, makeup game tight,
Hidin’ all the pain, showin’ only light.
Only good genes climb, that’s the code,
But the real stories? Man, they’re never told.

(Outro)
Mirror on the wall, who’s really there?
Beneath the gloss, the truth’s rare.
Gotta break free from this pixel chain,
Find the real me through the digital pain.





Title: Likes Over Life
hip-hop

(Chorus)
Scrollin’ nonstop, shame on me, no lie,
Pics so perfect but the truth runs dry.
Fake smiles flexin’, stress pushups, grind,
Hidin’ all the pain, keepin’ real behind.
Algorithm loves the shallow, fake parade,
Only good genes in the spotlight stay.
I wanna be real but the likes cost me,
Trendsetter trapped in this fake fantasy.

(Verse 1)
Snap that selfie, filter on blast,
Showin’ fake vibes, pretendin’ to last.
Makeup mask hides the late night cries,
Pushups and gym but I’m wearin’ thin disguise.

No place for feelings, no space for pain,
Hard work invisible, lost in the game.
Algorithm’s queen, boostin’ shallow scenes,
Real ones ghostin’ in the digital streams.

(Pre-Chorus)
Tryna break out but the price is steep,
Likes over life, got me losin’ sleep.
Scrollin’ and scrollin’, can’t hit stop,
Shame on me, trapped in this digital crop.

(Chorus)
Scrollin’ nonstop, shame on me, no lie,
Pics so perfect but the truth runs dry.
Fake smiles flexin’, stress pushups, grind,
Hidin’ all the pain, keepin’ real behind.
Algorithm loves the shallow, fake parade,
Only good genes in the spotlight stay.
I wanna be real but the likes cost me,
Trendsetter trapped in this fake fantasy.

(Verse 2)
Tryna set trends, but can’t lose my clout,
Being real costs likes, that’s what it’s about.
Show a flaw, lose the crowd, that’s the deal,
So I fake a vibe just to keep it real.

Scrollin’ feeds full of perfect façades,
But the truth’s locked deep behind these odds.
The algorithm loves the shallow parade,
While real ones fade like shadows in the shade.

(Bridge)
Caught in the scroll, it’s a vicious loop,
Want real, but I’m stuck in this group.
Likes over life, the cost is clear,
I’m the trendsetter who’s trapped in fear.

(Chorus)
Scrollin’ nonstop, shame on me, no lie,
Pics so perfect but the truth runs dry.
Fake smiles flexin’, stress pushups, grind,
Hidin’ all the pain, keepin’ real behind.
Algorithm loves the shallow, fake parade,
Only good genes in the spotlight stay.
I wanna be real but the likes cost me,
Trendsetter trapped in this fake fantasy.

(Outro)
One day I’ll break free from this pixel chain,
Show the real me, let go of the pain.
But for now, I’m stuck in this digital fight,
Likes over life, lost in the night.

Title: Mirror On The Screen
pop

[Verse 1]
Perfect pictures, glossy scenes,
Filtered smiles hiding what it means.
Stress pushups, makeup’s glow,
Behind the lens, no one knows.

Hard work hidden, no one sees,
Only the pretty get to be.
Algorithm loves the shallow kind,
Real ones lost, left behind.

[Pre-Chorus]
Scrollin’ endlessly, trapped in the light,
Shame on me, can’t stop tonight.
I wanna be real, but the price is high,
Lose the likes if I tell a lie.

[Chorus]
Mirror on the screen, show me who I am,
Behind the perfect pose, there’s more than the glam.
Fake smiles in the spotlight, real pain out of sight,
Algorithm’s queen, boosting the shallow life.

I’m a trendsetter caught in between,
Want to break free, but it costs my scene.
Scrollin’ and scrollin’, lost in the fight,
Shame on me for chasing the light.

[Verse 2]
Every post a crafted play,
Hiding scars that won’t go away.
Good genes rule the algorithm’s game,
While the rest fade without a name.

Fake personas get the crown,
Interesting ones get drowned.
I try to keep it real inside,
But out here, I gotta hide.

[Pre-Chorus]
Scrollin’ endlessly, trapped in the light,
Shame on me, can’t stop tonight.
I wanna be real, but the price is high,
Lose the likes if I tell a lie.

[Chorus]
Mirror on the screen, show me who I am,
Behind the perfect pose, there’s more than the glam.
Fake smiles in the spotlight, real pain out of sight,
Algorithm’s queen, boosting the shallow life.

I’m a trendsetter caught in between,
Want to break free, but it costs my scene.
Scrollin’ and scrollin’, lost in the fight,
Shame on me for chasing the light.

[Bridge]
Maybe one day I’ll break the chain,
Show my truth, not just the fame.
Till then I’m caught in this game,
Mirror on the screen, I’m not the same.

[Chorus]
Mirror on the screen, show me who I am,
Behind the perfect pose, there’s more than the glam.
Fake smiles in the spotlight, real pain out of sight,
Algorithm’s queen, boosting the shallow life.

I’m a trendsetter caught in between,
Want to break free, but it costs my scene.
Scrollin’ and scrollin’, lost in the fight,
Shame on me for chasing the light.
