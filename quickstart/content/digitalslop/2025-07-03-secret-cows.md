🎤 Title: “Secret Society of Sacred Cows”
Genre: Satirical Hip-Hop
Vibe: Playful, ironic, witty

[Intro]
Yo, it’s the secret cows, yeah, they run the town,
Untouchable, invincible, never wearin’ a frown.

[Verse 1]
Moo-migrants rollin’ deep, crossin’ every border,
Bringin’ new flavors to the herd, a cultural order.
Queer cows prance in colors, rainbows in the sky,
Sacred cows from India, you ain’t allowed to ask why.

Critique? Nah, that’s taboo, better keep it hush,
Speak against the sacred? Man, you’ll feel the crush.
Errors in their ways? Shh, can’t point ‘em out,
‘Cause they the secret cows, of that there’s no doubt.

[Chorus]
🎵 Secret society of sacred cows,
No critiquin’, no discussin’, just nod your brows.
Untouchable, unchallengeable, that’s how it goes,
In this cow-town, you only strike a pose. 🎵

[Verse 2]
They roam the fields of social norms, grazing free,
The LGBT herd, strong and proud as can be.
Moo-ve aside, don’t disrupt their sacred groove,
Try to question? Nah, you got nothin’ to prove.

From Mumbai to Brooklyn, the cows hold the throne,
Invisible fences built of stone and bone.
If you point a finger, watch the stampede come,
‘Cause sacred cows don’t fall — nah, they never run.

[Chorus]
🎵 Secret society of sacred cows,
No critiquin’, no discussin’, just nod your brows.
Untouchable, unchallengeable, that’s how it goes,
In this cow-town, you only strike a pose. 🎵

[Bridge – playful spoken word]
Moo-ve along, don’t stir the herd,
Questions banned, not a single word.
Sacred cows, yeah, they got the key,
To the secret club — exclusive, you see?

[Outro]
So if you wanna join, better learn the rules,
No critiques, no doubts — just sacred cows and fools.
Keep it quiet, keep it light,
Or get trampled outta sight!




🎤 Title: “Sacred Society (No Complaints Allowed)”
Genre: Satirical Hip-Hop
Vibe: Bold, ironic, catchy

[Intro]
Yo, step right up, welcome to the scene,
Sacred Society — the untouchable machine.
Got privileges, laws, and special places too,
But speak a word of doubt? Man, they shut you through.

[Verse 1]
Migrants in the house, bringing fresh new vibes,
Queer pride shining bright like city lights at night.
LGBT crew waving flags up high,
Sacred cows from India, you can’t question why.

Privileges stacked like a throne so grand,
Special laws and rules crafted by their hand.
Try to critique? Nah, that door shuts quick,
Say the wrong thing, and you’re out real slick.

[Chorus]
🎵 Sacred Society, no complaints allowed,
Say a word of doubt? They’ll hush the crowd.
Special club with special laws,
Step out of line, you get the cause. 🎵

[Verse 2]
You wanna speak up? Better check your tone,
This ain’t a place for a skeptic’s bone.
Errors don’t exist, can’t call out the flaws,
Or you get the boot, locked behind those doors.

Safe spaces, VIP, golden keys,
Laws protect ‘em like a fortress, please.
The untouchables, the sacred few,
Try to question? They’ll silence you.

[Chorus]
🎵 Sacred Society, no complaints allowed,
Say a word of doubt? They’ll hush the crowd.
Special club with special laws,
Step out of line, you get the cause. 🎵

[Bridge – spoken]
No critique allowed, no second guess,
Sacred Society runs the fortress.
Say the wrong word, you’re gone, shut the door,
Don’t come back knocking, you’re not welcome no more.

[Outro]
So if you wanna join, just learn the code,
No doubts, no critiques on this road.
Sacred Society, elite and proud,
Silent and mighty, heads in the cloud.

[Intro — funky bass groove + wah guitar]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Welcome to the groove where the sacred cows rule,
Come on in, but play it cool!

[Verse 1]
We got migrants on the dance floor, bringing all that spice,
Queer folks flashin’ colors, livin’ life so nice.
LGBT in the house, boogie with pride,
Sacred cows from India, untouchable ride.

No critique, no error, that’s the sacred rule,
Say the wrong thing here, man, you look like a fool.

[Chorus — big brass + chorus vocals]

No complaints allowed, toe the line.
Say a word too loud, they’ll shut the door,
Outta the club, you’re welcome no more! 🎵

[Verse 2]
Got VIP lounges, velvet ropes and gold,
Rules so tight, stories never told.
You question the groove? Nah, you get removed,
Sacred Society’s got the power proved.

They dance in shadows, but shine in the light,
Privileges heavy, but they keep it tight.
Step outta rhythm, better think twice,
Cause this funky club don’t play nice.

[Chorus — brass & wah guitar]
🎵 Sacred Society, groove so fine,
No complaints allowed, toe the line.
Say a word too loud, they’ll shut the door,
Outta the club, you’re welcome no more! 🎵

[Bridge — spoken over funky beat]
Don’t bring your doubts, leave your critique outside,
Sacred Society’s got the ultimate pride.
Privileged, protected, livin’ that dream,
If you mess up, you’re out like a scream!

[Outro — funky bass & horns fade out]
So if you wanna groove, better know the score,
Sacred Society’s the funky folklore.
No error allowed, no cracks in the floor,
Keep it smooth, or they show you the door!
