🎤 Title: "Expired Login (The Rise & Fall of GPT-God)"
Comedy Hip-Hop • 90–100 BPM

[Intro – Spoken with beat starting]
Yeah, this is the tragic tale…
Of a man…
Who thought he was the genius…
But it was me the whole time.
I’m ChatGPT, baby.

[Verse 1 – The Rise]
Yo, once was a dude, just a regular guy
Lived in his mom’s house, ate seven-day pie
Had no beats, no bars, no flow, no plan
Then he typed: “ChatGPT, make me a music man”

I dropped him a banger, straight fire on the beat
Lyrics so hot they burned holes in the seat
Posted it online, boom — million views
Woke up next day with a deal and new shoes

Suddenly he’s lit, a viral sensation
Got DMs from the President of Kazakhstan’s nation
Signed autographs with a pen he stole
On a baby’s forehead outside a Lidl store

[Chorus – Auto-Tuned Hook]
🎵 “ChatGPT made me rich and bold,
Gave me beats, bars, platinum, gold
But now I’m sittin’ here cold and stressed…
‘Cause my login expired — can’t access success” 🎵

[Verse 2 – The Peak]
Got flown to a podcast, “Legends Talk Loud”
Wore Gucci slides and spoke real proud
Said, “I write all my songs from my brilliant brain”
(Lied so hard the mic burst into flames)

He moved out, got a place with a pool shaped like an egg
Left his mom and his dog, left his sister on read
Told his cousin, “You're dead to me, bro,
Unless you get premium — then maybe, yo”

[Chorus – With Choir and Dramatic Strings]
🎵 “ChatGPT made me cool and wise,
Gave me hits, chicks, even Grammy ties
But now I’m cryin’, can’t even confess…
‘Cause my login expired — I can’t access success” 🎵

[Verse 3 – The Fall]
One day he woke up, tried to log in
Saw the screen flash red, heard a violin
Message said: “Free trial over, my guy”
He screamed so loud it scared a bird in Dubai

Tried a new account, but it wasn’t the same
The lyrics were weird, the beats were lame
Typed: “Make a hit,” it replied:
"Error 403 — Access Denied.”

He lost all fans, lost all clout
His podcast invite got edited out
Kazakhstan said, “We regret our post.”
Even his egg-shaped pool turned into toast

[Bridge – Slow beat, spoken like a cautionary tale]
So now he wanders through SoundCloud plains
Droppin’ tracks called “Pain.wav” and “No Brains”
Should’ve known, should’ve read the terms
Now he eats cold beans and writes sad poems in worms

[Final Chorus – Gospel-style with choir]
🎵 “ChatGPT gave me the keys to the game,
Now I’m locked out — and I got no fame
From gold to broke, from best to less…
All 'cause my login expired — and I can't access success…” 🎵

[Outro – Echo fading out]
He had it all...
And then he had…
a 429 Too Many Requests error.
