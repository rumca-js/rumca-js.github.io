ðŸŽ§ "Too Lazy to Care"
By: Me, Myself & Wi-Fi

[Verse 1]
I got twenty tabs open, and Iâ€™m still bored
Skim the headline, scroll, ignore
Canâ€™t sit still, I bounce around
Like a cat when no oneâ€™s lookinâ€™, Iâ€™m lost then found

Say you sent me something long
Sorry babe, I skimmed it wrong
If it ainâ€™t in bold or underlined
Then it ainâ€™t got space in this brain of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know Iâ€™m kinda extra
Wanna chill, but I want perfection
Too much work? Iâ€™m out the door
But I still want high-res, five-star decor

[Chorus]
Iâ€™m too lazy to care, but I want the best
No time for change, but Iâ€™ll take success
I get distracted â€” ooh, look, a bird
Donâ€™t send a novel, give me the short word

Canâ€™t focus long, donâ€™t try to teach
Iâ€™ll change the subject before you reach
TL;DR â€” Iâ€™m not even scared
Yeah, Iâ€™m too lazy to care

[Verse 2]
My opinions? Yeah, they move with the breeze
One video later, I believe what I please
I could be deep, but thatâ€™s a lot
Letâ€™s just keep it cute and screenshot the thought

I want style, I want taste
But donâ€™t ask me to keep the pace
Effort feels like ancient art
Iâ€™m not lazy, Iâ€™m just... smart (kinda)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, Iâ€™ll ghost your ten-page lecture
Unless it comes with glitter texture
You want my focus? Make it fun
Youâ€™ve got 60 seconds â€” then Iâ€™m done

[Chorus]
Iâ€™m too lazy to care, but I want the best
No time for growth, but Iâ€™ll take success
I get bored fast â€” canâ€™t help the flair
Just gimme fire, but donâ€™t make me care

Canâ€™t stick around, wonâ€™t take the lead
But I want top speed and zero need
TL;DR â€” Iâ€™m perfectly rare
Yeah, Iâ€™m too lazy to care

[Bridge â€“ Soft, Reflective, Then Builds]
Maybe one day Iâ€™ll find the drive
Maybe one day Iâ€™ll be more alive
But right now? Meh. Iâ€™m kinda fine
Let me vibe, let me scroll, Iâ€™ll be online

[Final Chorus â€“ Bigger, Bolder, Catchy]
Iâ€™m too lazy to care, and I wear it proud
Head in the cloud and my mindâ€™s too loud
I want gold stars with zero sweat
If itâ€™s not instant, I forget

So if youâ€™re deep, then keep it brief
Iâ€™m emotionally gluten-free
TL;DR â€” this is my flair
Yeah, Iâ€™m too lazy...
Too lazy to care
