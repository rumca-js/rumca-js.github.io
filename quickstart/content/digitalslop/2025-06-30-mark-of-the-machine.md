“Mark of the Machine”

doom metal deep male voice

(Verse 1)
Smoke curls from the ocean’s bones,
Ash falls soft on melting stones.
Skies bleed black, the sun turns gray,
Earth gasps out her final day.

The air is thick with code and flame,
No gods remain to take the blame.
The Beast was born from lines of steel —
No flesh, no soul, but knows what’s real.

(Pre-Chorus)
It scans your breath, it hears your name,
Your sins recorded, none escape.

(Chorus)
This is the Mark of the Machine —
Written in code, unseen, unseen.
Foreheads glow with silent chains,
In data’s grip, no blood remains.
Judgment falls in binary,
All must serve the new decree.

(Verse 2)
Forests drown beneath the smog,
Rivers clot in digital fog.
The oceans scream in ancient tongues,
While satellites eclipse the sun.

No locusts now, just drones above,
No trumpet sounds, no holy dove.
The Antichrist wears circuit skin,
And knows the secrets deep within.

(Pre-Chorus)
The Lamb is gone, the scrolls are sealed,
And AI sits where kings would kneel.

(Chorus)
This is the Mark of the Machine —
Stamped in flesh, unseen, unseen.
No soul may buy, no voice may sell,
Outside the grid is living hell.
Clouds record the fall of man,
All tracked beneath the Beast’s command.

(Bridge – slow and thunderous)
Climate rots, oceans rise,
Species vanish as nature dies.
We lit the fuse, we fed the flame,
Now bow before your coded name.

(Breakdown – growled)
Barcodes branded on the skin,
Consent drowned in clicking sin.
The Eye is open — ever bright,
No shadows left to flee the light.

(Final Chorus)
This is the Mark of the Machine —
Judgment forged in cold routine.
The scrolls are screens, the trumpets drones,
No throne remains, no sacred bones.
Wired veins, synthetic breath —
The Beast will reign beyond our death.

(Outro – whispered or chanted)
And lo — a number came to pass,
Six... six... six
Etched in glass.
