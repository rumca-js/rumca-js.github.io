Title: "Googles Type"

Hip hop, rap

(Verse 1)
I’m the face behind the screen, smile clean, suits tight,
Playin’ nice with shareholders, but I’m squeezin’ you all night.
Hook you with new features, bait you in the game,
Once I lock you in my grip, it ain’t never the same.

Ads poppin’ nonstop, cash flow never dry,
Paid accounts, premium stacks — watch my profits fly.
Monopoly’s my weapon, I rig the market tight,
Remove the functions you love, push ads day and night.

(Chorus)
Yeah, I’m the shady type, slick and cold,
Playin’ nice while I’m stealing what you hold.
Distraction’s my magic, pockets I swipe,
Admit it, baby — I’m that shady type.

(Verse 2)
Product gets worse, but the money gets better,
I’m the cold-handed gambler, no love for the debtor.
Stealin’ data streams, training AI in the back,
Government deals on deck — I’m keepin’ secrets packed.

Users trapped in my maze, scrolling all the time,
Every click, every move — yeah, it’s all a crime.
Pay more, get less, that’s my golden rule,
In the name of progress? Nah, I’m just a fool.

(Chorus)
Yeah, I’m the shady type, slick and cold,
Playin’ nice while I’m stealing what you hold.
Distraction’s my magic, pockets I swipe,
Admit it, baby — I’m that shady type.

(Bridge)
Watch me pull the strings, I’m the puppet master,
Play you like a fool, profits climb faster.
Monopolies tighten, no escape in sight,
Remove what you love, replace it with more light.

(Outro)
I’m the company with a face, the villain you can’t fight,
Smile wide, pockets full — I’m the shady type.
You’re just data in my game, caught inside my hype,
Remember my name — I’m that shady type.
