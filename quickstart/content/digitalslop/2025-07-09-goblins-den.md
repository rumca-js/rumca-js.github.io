ðŸŽ¸ The Den of the PC Goblin ðŸª•
(Genre: Folk Metal / Trollish Chaos)

[Intro â€“ Spoken/Whispered]
Deep in the roots of the internet's flame,
Lurks a creature with no shame.
Fingers greasy, mind unclean...
The goblin waits behind the screen...

[Verse 1]
In a cave of mold and cheeto dust,
Sat a goblin, wicked and unjust.
With a headset forged from cursed bone,
He claimed the World of Warcraft throne.

He raided realms both far and near,
And filled the chat with filthy sneers.
From Elwynn Woods to Orgrimmar,
His words were like a goblin scar.

[Chorus - All voices shouting]
Beware the PC Goblinâ€™s wrath!
Heâ€™ll flame your guild, heâ€™ll break your path!
He haunts the boards and forums blackâ€”
If you talk smack, heâ€™ll smack you back!
Banished, cursed, yet still not goneâ€”
The goblin trolls forever on!

[Verse 2]
He cursed at elves, he mocked the dwarves,
Spammed dark memes in toxic swarms.
He made a priest uninstall life,
Then flirted with a night elf's wife.

His insults flew like poisoned darts,
He took no sides, he broke all hearts.
The mods cried foul, the bans came fastâ€”
But goblin legends always last.

[Bridge â€“ Acoustic/Folk Interlude with Fiddle & Flute]

In forums closed and threads long dead,
They whisper what the green fiend said.
He speaks in caps, his grammar foulâ€”
You hear his laugh, youâ€™ll hear it howl...

[Chorus - Even more intense]
Beware the PC Goblinâ€™s wrath!
Heâ€™ll flame your soul, he'll steal your staff!
From Discord depths to Steamâ€™s cracked halls,
He spams in chat, he teabags all!
Banished, cursed, yet still not goneâ€”
The goblin trolls forever on!

[Verse 3 â€“ Half-growled, half-sung]
Now tales are told in gamer bars,
Of the goblin banned from ten avatars.
But still he lurks in shadows dim,
If you rage too loudâ€”you summon him.

[Final Chorus â€“ Everyone in a drinking chant style]
Beware the PC Goblinâ€™s rage!
Heâ€™ll call you names, heâ€™ll post your age!
Heâ€™s got no life, heâ€™s got no shame,
But damn, heâ€™s good at every game!
Though mods may strike and admins frown,
The goblin lives to burn you down!

[Outro â€“ Spoken/echoed]
So guard your chat, and mute your mic,
Or feel his wrath... by Friday night.
The PC Goblin never sleepsâ€”
Heâ€™s watching... from the cursed deep.
