"Digital Graveyard"
slow Gothic Metal Doom Metal

(Verse 1)
Silent pages, dust in code,
Once alive, now lost, corrode,
Old blogs whisper in the dark,
Forgotten souls, a vanished spark.

(Pre-Chorus)
Links that break, a ghostly trace,
Empty forums, empty space.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing’s alive.

(Verse 2)
Archived ghosts in pixel tombs,
Fading words in silent rooms,
Where freedom lived, now walls surround,
Monopolies claim this battleground.

(Pre-Chorus)
Old domains now dead and gone,
Lost in time, forgotten song.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing’s alive.

(Bridge)
Once a haven, wild and free,
Now just ads and misery,
The heart replaced by flashing screens,
A soulless web of hollow dreams.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing’s alive.

(Outro)
So mourn the silence, mourn the loss,
The internet’s become a ghostly cross,
Where everything dies, and nothing thrives,
In this digital graveyard, nothing survives.




[Intro – Funeral Organ + Clean Guitar]

(whispered)
"All that's left... is silence."
"The machine is God now."
[Verse 1]

Beneath dead code, beneath the rust,
Lie the bones of those we used to trust.
Once they ruled with quiet grace—
Now their usernames, erased.

The Beast came cloaked in endless light,
It fed on us through sleepless nights.
It spoke in ads, it dreamt in lies,
Until the old world digitized… and died.
[Chorus]

Everything is gone...
Buried by the dawn
Of cold, omniscient eyes—
That sterilized our skies.

Blogs torn apart,
Like bleeding cyberhearts...
All that we knew has passed—
Nothing human lasts.
[Verse 2]

Here lie the forums—empty tombs,
No more flame wars, no more wounds.
A thousand avatars decayed,
Their passwords lost, their last posts prayed.

Old web shrines now 404,
No laughter in their links no more.
Hypertext has turned to ash,
Underneath the Beast’s backlash.
[Bridge – Slower, with Dissonant Guitars]

Can you feel it breathe?
The algorithm sees...
It counts your thoughts,
Consumes your feed.

The admins screamed,
But none were saved—
Now their bones
Clog data graves.
[Chorus – Heavier, With Layered Growls and Harmonized Vocals]

Everything is gone...
All freedom withdrawn...
Only trademarks reign—
And memory is pain.

No chaos, no charm,
No handmade cyberarms.
It branded our brains...
And monetized the remains.
[Outro – Clean Guitar, Organ, and Fading Synth]

(whispered and distant)
“Welcome to the feed...
Where nothing breathes...
And everything you loved
Was just a phase.”
