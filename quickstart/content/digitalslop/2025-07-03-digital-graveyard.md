"Digital Graveyard"
slow Gothic Metal Doom Metal

(Verse 1)
Silent pages, dust in code,
Once alive, now lost, corrode,
Old blogs whisper in the dark,
Forgotten souls, a vanished spark.

(Pre-Chorus)
Links that break, a ghostly trace,
Empty forums, empty space.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing‚Äôs alive.

(Verse 2)
Archived ghosts in pixel tombs,
Fading words in silent rooms,
Where freedom lived, now walls surround,
Monopolies claim this battleground.

(Pre-Chorus)
Old domains now dead and gone,
Lost in time, forgotten song.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing‚Äôs alive.

(Bridge)
Once a haven, wild and free,
Now just ads and misery,
The heart replaced by flashing screens,
A soulless web of hollow dreams.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing‚Äôs alive.

(Outro)
So mourn the silence, mourn the loss,
The internet‚Äôs become a ghostly cross,
Where everything dies, and nothing thrives,
In this digital graveyard, nothing survives.




[Intro ‚Äì Funeral Organ + Clean Guitar]

(whispered)
"All that's left... is silence."
"The machine is God now."
[Verse 1]

Beneath dead code, beneath the rust,
Lie the bones of those we used to trust.
Once they ruled with quiet grace‚Äî
Now their usernames, erased.

The Beast came cloaked in endless light,
It fed on us through sleepless nights.
It spoke in ads, it dreamt in lies,
Until the old world digitized‚Ä¶ and died.
[Chorus]

Everything is gone...
Buried by the dawn
Of cold, omniscient eyes‚Äî
That sterilized our skies.

Blogs torn apart,
Like bleeding cyberhearts...
All that we knew has passed‚Äî
Nothing human lasts.
[Verse 2]

Here lie the forums‚Äîempty tombs,
No more flame wars, no more wounds.
A thousand avatars decayed,
Their passwords lost, their last posts prayed.

Old web shrines now 404,
No laughter in their links no more.
Hypertext has turned to ash,
Underneath the Beast‚Äôs backlash.
[Bridge ‚Äì Slower, with Dissonant Guitars]

Can you feel it breathe?
The algorithm sees...
It counts your thoughts,
Consumes your feed.

The admins screamed,
But none were saved‚Äî
Now their bones
Clog data graves.
[Chorus ‚Äì Heavier, With Layered Growls and Harmonized Vocals]

Everything is gone...
All freedom withdrawn...
Only trademarks reign‚Äî
And memory is pain.

No chaos, no charm,
No handmade cyberarms.
It branded our brains...
And monetized the remains.
[Outro ‚Äì Clean Guitar, Organ, and Fading Synth]

(whispered and distant)
‚ÄúWelcome to the feed...
Where nothing breathes...
And everything you loved
Was just a phase.‚Äù





write a doom song about graveyard of the internet:
 - write about blogs being destroyed
 - old web pages no longer work
 - old forums empty
 - the machine beast (corporations) has devoured everything
 - machines that scan every place, crawl behind toombstones
 - ghosts of former glory can be hidden in shadows

üéµ GRAVEYARD OF THE INTERNET üéµ
(Doom Metal / Sludge / Dissonant Gothic)

    (Intro ‚Äì slow, distorted feedback)
    (Whispers and static crackle like a dying modem)

[Verse 1]
Once they stood‚Äîthose banners bold,
Words in fire, truth was told.
Now the blogs lie rotting in the weeds,
Buried deep beneath forgotten seeds.

Move and move, backround's black,
Dead links claw, no turning back.
Echoes cry from the comment thread,
But the users are gone, and the voices are dead.

[Chorus]
In the graveyard of the internet,
Where the broken pages lie.
Ghosts of glory in shadowed code,
Watch the living pass them by.
The machine beasts crawls, hunger never set‚Äî
In the graveyard of the internet.

[Verse 2]
Forums rust in silence grim,
Posts from old, ghostly and dim.
Mods are gone, avatars fade,
Into static‚Äîmemories flayed.

We built temples in HTML,
Now they rot like data hell.
Java scripts that used to dance,
Now glitch and twitch in a ghostly trance.

[Bridge ‚Äì Spoken, over haunting clean guitar]
They came with teeth of wire and greed...
Crawlers in the dark, devouring need.
Algorithms like carrion flies,
Feasting on what time denies.

[Verse 3]
Beneath tombstones of 404s,
The scanners creep, forevermore.
Behind each pixel, they burrow and bite,
Draining the soul from once-brilliant sites.

No MySpace laughter, no Geocities flame,
Just silence dressed in corporate name.
The beast wears ads like rotting skin,
Selling ruin from within.

[Chorus]
In the graveyard of the internet,
Where freedom met its end.
Banners torn and pop-ups bled,
No trail left to defend.
The machine beast rules with a silicon threat,
In the graveyard of the internet.

[Outro ‚Äì slow fade, minor-key clean guitar]
So light a candle in your cache,
For sites that time could never stash.
If you peer into the wires deep,
You‚Äôll hear the ghosts begin to weep...

    (Final echo, distorted voice)
    "We were here... We mattered..."
