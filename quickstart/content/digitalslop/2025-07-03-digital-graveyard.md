write a song like type o negative:
 - be inspired by "everything dies"
 - write about blogs being destroyed
 - old web pages no longer work
 - old forums empty
 - everything is corporate on internet


"Digital Graveyard"
slow Gothic Metal Doom Metal

(Verse 1)
Silent pages, dust in code,
Once alive, now lost, corrode,
Old blogs whisper in the dark,
Forgotten souls, a vanished spark.

(Pre-Chorus)
Links that break, a ghostly trace,
Empty forums, empty space.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing’s alive.

(Verse 2)
Archived ghosts in pixel tombs,
Fading words in silent rooms,
Where freedom lived, now walls surround,
Monopolies claim this battleground.

(Pre-Chorus)
Old domains now dead and gone,
Lost in time, forgotten song.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing’s alive.

(Bridge)
Once a haven, wild and free,
Now just ads and misery,
The heart replaced by flashing screens,
A soulless web of hollow dreams.

(Chorus)
Digital graveyard, memories erased,
The wild web swallowed by the corporate haze,
No voices rising, no dreams survive,
In this cold machine, nothing’s alive.

(Outro)
So mourn the silence, mourn the loss,
The internet’s become a ghostly cross,
Where everything dies, and nothing thrives,
In this digital graveyard, nothing survives.
