Title: Unchecked
Hip-Hop

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I’m the king of clicks, no fact-checks needed,
Spinnin’ stories wild, ‘cause the views gotta be feeded,
Reaction vids on deck, drama on repeat,
I’m the main event, ain’t nobody compete.

Off-camera? Yeah, I handle biz,
If you come at me wrong, I don’t miss,
Critique? Man, I laugh and ignore,
They talk behind my back, but I’m gettin’ more.

[Chorus]
I know it’s dirty, but I don’t care,
Money rollin’ in, Lambo in the air,
Haters hate, but I’m living large,
Clickbait king, I’m running this charge.

[Verse 2]
Fake tears, fake fights, it’s part of the game,
I’m the puppet master, they know my name,
Drama sells, and I’m cashin’ checks,
While they throw shade, I’m stacking my specs.

Off-screen I’m savage, no cameras to see,
Handle my business quietly, that’s me,
Try to knock me down, I just rise,
Critique ain’t nothing but noise and lies.

[Chorus]
I know it’s dirty, but I don’t care,
Money rollin’ in, Lambo in the air,
Haters hate, but I’m living large,
Clickbait king, I’m running this charge.

[Bridge]
I’m the king of the clicks, the throne’s in my grip,
They talk about morals, but I never slip,
Fake it till you make it, that’s my creed,
In this jungle of views, I’m the breed they need.

[Outro]
So bring your critique, bring your hate,
I’m stacking millions, sealed my fate,
Lambo doors up, I’m riding fast,
In this game of clicks, I’m built to last.
