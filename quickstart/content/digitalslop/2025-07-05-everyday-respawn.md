 write a hip hop song full of video game motifs:
 - "I strike like doom guy"
 - "Battlecruiser ready"
 - being protected like by Jim Raynor
 - it should describe a simple normal day using these motifs
 - use many texts from games


🎮 "Everyday Respawn"

[Mid-tempo beat, synths with arcade blips and 8-bit samples]
[Intro – Game voice clips layered with synth]

“Battlecruiser operational.”
“Lock and load.”
“Press start to continue.”
“You have died of dysentery.”

[Verse 1]

Wake up, “New Game Started,” sun on my face
Inventory full but I’m pickin’ up the pace
Grab the coffee — “Health restored” beep
I strike like Doomguy — no time for sleep

“It's dangerous to go alone — take this”
Keys in my hand, I’m ready to persist
Out the door, “Enemy spotted” on the street
I’m battlecruiser ready, no retreat

Text scrolls — “Mission briefing: survive the day”
Walk through NPCs like I’m in GTA
“Press F to pay respects” to my morning grind
Protected like Jim Raynor, shields up, aligned

[Chorus]

I strike like Doomguy, ripping through the gray
Battlecruiser ready, I’m built for this fray
Protected like Raynor, no damage, no fall
Just a simple day but I’m leveling all

“Achievement unlocked” — making it through
“Checkpoint reached” — sky still blue
From dawn to dusk, this is my play
Respawn every morning, press start to slay

[Verse 2]

Email pop — “Objective updated,” keep it clean
“You have entered a safe zone,” I’m unseen
Lunch break loot, “Item acquired: sandwich”
“Level up!” energy replenished

Back at work, “Quest accepted” — keep it steady
“Warning: Low health” but I’m battle-ready
“Scan complete: no hostiles nearby”
Protected like Raynor — no reason to hide

“Game saved” as the day ticks down
Simple life but I’m the king of this town
“Press X to interact” with my vibe
I’m the player one in my own archive

[Chorus]

I strike like Doomguy, ripping through the gray
Battlecruiser ready, I’m built for this fray
Protected like Raynor, no damage, no fall
Just a simple day but I’m leveling all

“Achievement unlocked” — making it through
“Checkpoint reached” — sky still blue
From dawn to dusk, this is my play
Respawn every morning, press start to slay

[Bridge – Spoken with glitchy effects]

“The cake is a lie.”
“Hadouken!”
“Would you kindly...”
“Finish him.”

Life’s a game, code in my veins
Every day’s a quest — I play no chains
[Outro]

“Game Over? Nah, I respawn.”
“Continue?” Hell yeah — at dawn
I strike like Doomguy, tech on my side
Battlecruiser ready — it’s a smooth ride

“Stay awhile and listen.”
“Mission complete.”
