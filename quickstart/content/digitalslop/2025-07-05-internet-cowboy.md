rite dark country song about internet cowboy
 - rides alone
 - rides into the worlds end sunset
 - does self hosting (does not rely on big tech)
 - was not part of AI gold rush


ðŸ¤ ðŸŒ’ "The Last Internet Cowboy"

(Dark Country / Gothic Americana)
Slow tempo, deep baritone vocals, twangy Telecaster, sparse dobro or banjo, reverb-heavy atmosphere)
[Verse 1]

He donâ€™t ride for Google, donâ€™t pray to the cloud
Keeps his server in a shed, far away from the crowd
A rusted modem, and a heart full of code
Black coffee, .44, and a static IP road

No sponsors on his chest, no likes in his name
He donâ€™t dance for the algorithmâ€™s fame
When the world went gold with synthetic minds
He tipped his hat, and rode past the signs
[Chorus]

ðŸŽµ
Heâ€™s the last internet cowboy
On a plain of broken screens
No gods of ad or data
Just wires and old machines
Self-hosted, soul encrypted
Not bought, not sold, not tamed
He rides into the sunset
Where no one's left... to name
ðŸŽµ
[Verse 2]

They came with promises, silver and fast
Promised the future, erased the past
He watched the feeds rot down to skin
And said goodbye to what couldâ€™ve been

No AI gold in his saddlebag
Just text files and a tattered flag
He runs his own mail, he seeds his own fire
And he don't speak, â€˜cause the netâ€™s got wires
[Chorus â€“ Refrain, slower and heavier]

ðŸŽµ
Heâ€™s the last internet cowboy
Through the echo and the fog
A ghost in cached old forums
A glitch inside the log
Self-built, self-banned, self-sworn
To die beneath no brand
He rides into the sunset
With a flintlock in his hand
ðŸŽµ
[Bridge â€“ Spoken, like a prayer]

They mined their minds for silver clicks
Traded blood for beta tricks
But he kept his code... and walked alone
Through firewalls made of bone
[Outro â€“ Slow pickinâ€™ guitar, fading echo]

ðŸŽµ
No one knows where cowboys go
When the last page turns, and the breezes blow
But thereâ€™s a signal in the distant dust...
That says one man never gave up trust...
ðŸŽµ

(guitar fades, the sound of an old dial-up modem crackles, then cuts to silence)
