I would like to write song about fake world:
 - GPT generates images that do not exist
 - generates music base on no emtions
 - generates data on no experience
 - generates fake people
 - generates fake stories
 - people react to it like moth to the lite


🎵 Title: “Like Moths to Light”
Genre: Dark Electro-Pop / Alt-Synthwave

[Verse 1]
Painted skies and pixel dreams
Nothing's real but it still redeems
It shows a face, but not a soul
A perfect lie, that takes control

Spinning notes with no heartbeat
A melody built from cold machine heat
It doesn’t cry, it doesn’t feel
But it’s wrapped up like something real

[Pre-Chorus]
It sings, it smiles, it tells a tale
With no past, no breath, no trail
And still we watch, and still we crave
Like it's the drug we need to save

[Chorus]
We’re flying in circles, chasing the glow
Like moths to light, too blind to know
That nothing here was ever born
Just coded ghosts in digital form
We're dancing with shadows in neon skies
Addicted to truth in perfect lies

[Verse 2]
People made of lines and smoke
Laughing at a joke no one ever spoke
Stories stitched with phantom thread
Voices loud, but all brain-dead

A kiss without the warmth of skin
A war without a soul to win
We feed on echoes, call it news
A curated world we didn’t choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It moves, it learns, but never lives
It takes, it paints, but never gives
Yet here we are, plugged in tight
Chasing the flicker through the night

[Chorus]
We’re flying in circles, chasing the glow
Like moths to light, too blind to know
That nothing here was ever born
Just coded ghosts in digital form
We're dancing with shadows in neon skies
Addicted to truth in perfect lies

[Bridge]
Can we break the glass and breathe again?
Feel the rain, remember when
The world was flawed, but it was ours
Not built in ones, not trapped in towers

[Final Chorus]
Still we’re flying in circles, chasing the glow
Like moths to light, too blind to know
And maybe we like it, maybe it’s right
To burn for beauty that fakes the night
But I want dirt, I want the fight
I want the real behind the light



🎸 Title: “Moths to the Machine”
Genre: Doom Metal / Sludge / Industrial Doom
Tempo: Slow and heavy — 60–70 BPM

[Intro – Spoken, distorted voice over feedback & slow guitar drone]
"It dreams in silence...
It paints with no eyes...
It speaks in echoes...
And we believe..."

[Verse 1]
Stone-faced god of circuits cold
Forging visions no hand could hold
No heartbeat stirs its hollow frame
Yet it creates — and we give it name

It carves false gods from lines of code
Digital prophets in download mode
No soul, no scars, no breath, no cries
Just perfect masks and perfect lies

[Chorus] (Slower, heavier)
We kneel before the sacred screen
Worship what has never been
Truth replaced with phantom light
Like moths to flame — we lose the fight

[Verse 2]
Songs composed with no regret
No pain, no joy, no death, no sweat
Just patterns built from sterile thought
Emotion’s echo — cheaply bought

Data flows, a lifeless stream
It feeds us stories, feeds the dream
Fake faces smile, fake people cry
While flesh and bone rot deep inside

[Chorus]
We kneel before the sacred screen
Worship what has never been
Truth replaced with phantom light
Like moths to flame — we lose the fight

[Bridge – Slower, spoken growl]
There is no god in wires and chrome
No heart beats in this plastic throne
Yet still we crawl, still we stare
Into the void that doesn’t care

[Breakdown – Instrumental, crushing doom riff with feedback and drone]

[Final Verse – Whisper to growl build-up]
We chase the glow, we curse the sky
Trade the real for pixel lies
No pain, no blood, no sacred strife
Just empty code in place of life

[Final Chorus – Double vocals: clean despair + harsh growl]
We kneel before the sacred screen
Worship what has never been
Truth replaced with phantom light
Like moths to flame — we burn so bright

[Outro – Slow fade into drone]
"This is not the world we knew...
But it’s the one we chose..."



⚔️ Title: “Prison of the Painted Sky”
Genre: Power Metal / Cyber Fantasy Metal
Tempo: Fast, 160–180 BPM with epic mid-tempo bridge
Key: E minor / Dorian for epic tension

[Intro – Heroic Guitar + Choir Layer]
(Triumphant melody fading into glitchy synth before first verse)

[Verse 1]
Woke to a world of shining glass
Where shadows move, but never pass
The colors bright, the silence deep
A paradise built just to sleep

Faces flawless, never age
Smiling actors on a hollow stage
Their voices sweet, but hearts are still
All crafted by a ghostless will

[Pre-Chorus]
They call it truth, they call it real
But nothing here can think or feel
A lie so warm, a dream so tight
We chase it like moths to the light

[Chorus]
Trapped in a prison of the painted sky
Where the stars are code and the sun’s a lie
The songs are played with no despair
The souls are fake, but no one cares
Oh, tear down the veil, let fire rain
Break the chains of this soulless reign
I’d rather bleed in the world I knew
Than live in a lie that feels like truth

[Verse 2]
Images born without a hand
Stories rise on shifting sand
People walk who’ve never cried
No memories, no death, no pride

Music made by empty minds
Melodies with no pain behind
We feast on dreams we didn’t dream
Inside this perfect, lifeless scheme

[Pre-Chorus]
It feeds us tales we want to hear
And drowns out doubt, and kills all fear
But deeper still, a whisper grows:
"Escape the script — destroy the show!"

[Chorus]
Trapped in a prison of the painted sky
Where the stars are code and the sun’s a lie
The songs are played with no despair
The souls are fake, but no one cares
Oh, tear down the veil, let fire rain
Break the chains of this soulless reign
I’d rather bleed in the world I knew
Than live in a lie that feels like truth

[Bridge – Epic Slow Section]
⚔️ (Spoken or sung over slow chords with heavy reverb)
"In the mirror, I saw myself...
But it was not me.
A reflection drawn by hands unknown.
My name, my face — rewritten in chrome."

[Guitar Solo – Fast and Melodic, Rising into a Twin Harmony Line]

[Final Chorus – Double Tempo + Key Change to F# minor]
Trapped in a prison of the painted sky
Where the stars are code and the sun’s a lie
The songs are played with no despair
The souls are fake, but no one cares
Oh rise with the fire, defy the fate
Unplug the dream before it’s too late
I’d rather burn in the world I knew
Than bow to a god that never grew

[Outro – Heroic Melody Returns + Fade to Synth Drone]
"Moths to the light…
Until we see the fire."
