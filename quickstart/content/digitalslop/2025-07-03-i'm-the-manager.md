🎤 Title: “I’m The Manager”
Genre: Hip-Hop / Rap
Vibe: Confident, commanding, unapologetic

[Intro]
Step inside my office, I run this game,
I’m the manager — remember the name.

[Verse 1]
I’m the boss behind the screen, control the scene,
Shadow ban your voice, wipe you clean.
Close accounts with no reason, just like that,
One wrong move, and you’re gone — tip your hat.

Mark your words forbidden, watch ‘em disappear,
Add or remove features — no explanation here.
Change the rules, switch the fees, pay to play,
You’re just players in my game, what more can I say?

[Chorus]
🎵 I’m the manager, king of the show,
Control your feed, everywhere you go.
In bed with the gov, secrets we keep,
Selling your data while you’re lost in sleep. 🎵

[Verse 2]
I track your clicks, your likes, your scroll,
Turn your info into gold — that’s how I roll.
Algorithm puppet master, pullin’ the strings,
Feed you what I want, control what sings.

You think it’s free? Nah, it’s a trap,
Subscription fees rising — better watch your back.
I’m the gatekeeper, the digital czar,
Behind every login, I’m the star.

[Chorus]
🎵 I’m the manager, king of the show,
Control your feed, everywhere you go.
In bed with the gov, secrets we keep,
Selling your data while you’re lost in sleep. 🎵

[Bridge]
Don’t blame me, it’s just business, son,
Power’s currency — I’m the one who won.
You play by my rules or you get shut down,
I’m the manager, wearin’ the crown.

[Outro]
So next time you scroll, remember my face,
I’m the manager — I run this place.

⚔️ Title: “King of the Digital Throne”
Genre: Power Metal
Tempo: Fast & epic (180 BPM)
Vibe: Dominant, grandiose, theatrical

[Intro – galloping riffs, choir chanting]
Choir:
All hail the King!
All hail the King!

[Verse 1]
I wear the crown of endless code,
Master of the data road.
Shadow banished voices fall,
I answer to no one at all.

Close your accounts, no reason why,
My law’s decree — obey or die.
Forbidden words I mark with fire,
Control your thoughts, your will, desire.

[Pre-Chorus]
Change the game, shift the rules,
Peasants play like fools.
Pay them gold to fight my wars,
I open markets, close the doors!

[Chorus – soaring, powerful]
🎵 King of the digital throne,
Ruler of the silicon stone!
I hold the keys, I make the fate,
Your lives I dominate! 🎵

[Verse 2]
Add or strip the functions fast,
I reign supreme, my power vast.
Subscription fees rise like the tide,
No place to run, nowhere to hide.

I sell your secrets, trade your pain,
In bed with kings who share my reign.
A puppet master, dark and grand,
I shape the world with iron hand.

[Pre-Chorus]
Change the game, shift the rules,
Peasants play like fools.
Pay them gold to fight my wars,
I open markets, close the doors!

[Chorus – full choir & harmony]
🎵 King of the digital throne,
Ruler of the silicon stone!
I hold the keys, I make the fate,
Your lives I dominate! 🎵

[Bridge – blazing guitar solo, thunder drums]

[Breakdown – chanting with heavy riffs]
Bow before the King of bytes,
Master of your days and nights!
No escape, no second chance,
In my web, you all dance!

[Final Chorus – double time, full power]
🎵 King of the digital throne,
Ruler of the silicon stone!
I hold the keys, I make the fate,
Your lives I dominate! 🎵

[Outro – fading choir and echoing riff]
All hail the King...
All hail the King...
