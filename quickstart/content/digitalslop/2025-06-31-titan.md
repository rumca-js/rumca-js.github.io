 - it is a dragon hoarding gold, while destroying people
 - the beast is forever hungry, of money and power
 - it devours people (metaphorically)
 - does not follow morality
 - destroys lands, pollute
 - it control entire world
 - governments, countries bow
 - humanity follows


Title: The Colossus of Greed
doom metal

Verse 1:
In iron halls the monster wakes,
Its hunger endless, never slakes.
Feeding on gold, on lives it feeds,
A shadow cast o’er broken creeds.

Pre-Chorus:
No law commands, no voice can fight,
Its empire rules eternal night.

Chorus:
The Colossus of Greed, forever fed,
Devouring the living, devouring the dead.
Morality shattered beneath its heel,
All worlds bow, and all hearts kneel.

Verse 2:
The poisoned rivers, scorched lands wide,
Its touch corrupts, no place to hide.
Governments crumble, kings are slaves,
To this beast born in digital graves.

Pre-Chorus:
No plea, no prayer can break the chain,
Its hunger grows, a ceaseless bane.

Chorus:
The Colossus of Greed, forever fed,
Devouring the living, devouring the dead.
Morality shattered beneath its heel,
All worlds bow, and all hearts kneel.

Bridge:
It speaks no truth, it heeds no law,
Its power absolute, none withdraw.
Humanity follows blind and cold,
In chains of silicon, bought and sold.

Outro:
The beast commands the endless night,
A world consumed by endless blight.
No hope remains, the throne is sealed,
The Colossus rules—the fate is real.


Title: Rise of the Golden Calf
power metal

Verse 1:
From towers tall, the beast awakes,
A dragon forged in cold mistakes.
Golden scales, hoarding all,
The monster answers power’s call.

Managers with iron hands,
Pull the strings across the lands.
No mercy shown, no soul to save,
The world consumed, a fiery grave.

Pre-Chorus:
No law can bind this endless hunger,
No voice withstands its fearsome thunder!

Chorus:
Rise, rise, the golden calf!
A beast of steel and wrath!
Devouring dreams, devouring light,
Ruling all with deadly might!

Verse 2:
Polluted skies and broken earth,
The cost of unrelenting worth.
Governments bow, nations fall,
Chained beneath its iron thrall.

It crushes morals, breaks the law,
No heart to feel, no cause to draw.
The hunger grows, a roaring flood,
A beast built on greed and blood.

Pre-Chorus:
No plea or fight can slow its pace,
Only gold can buy its grace!

Chorus:
Rise, rise, the golden calf!
A beast of steel and wrath!
Devouring dreams, devouring light,
Ruling all with deadly might!

Bridge (Guitar solo)

Bridge 2:
Managers sit on thrones of gold,
Cold ambition, hearts grown old.
Humanity marches, chained and blind,
Following shadows left behind.

Final Chorus:
Rise, rise, the golden calf!
A beast of steel and wrath!
Devouring dreams, devouring light,
Ruling all with deadly might!

Outro:
The dragon sleeps beneath the gold,
A tale of power dark and cold.
Forever hungry, never done,
The golden calf, the fallen one!



Title: Stand Against the Golden Calf
power metal

Verse 1:
I stand alone upon the battlefield,
The shadow grows, the truth revealed.
A golden calf, a dragon’s breath,
A beast of power, born of death.

Managers command its iron claws,
They twist the world with endless laws.
Its hunger burns through sky and stone,
A kingdom built on flesh and bone.

Pre-Chorus:
No law can chain this cursed might,
No justice stands against the night.

Chorus:
Rise, golden calf! Your flame ignites,
But I will stand to fight your blight!
You hoard your gold, consume the weak,
But I will break the chains you seek!

Verse 2:
Polluted rivers, scorched earth’s cry,
The dragon’s breath turns blue to dry.
Governments kneel, bow to the throne,
But I stand tall, I stand alone.

Morality shattered in your wake,
A world enslaved for power’s sake.
You devour hope with greedy jaws,
No god, no law can stop your cause.

Pre-Chorus:
The beast grows strong on human pain,
But still I rise to break its reign.

Chorus:
Rise, golden calf! Your flame ignites,
But I will stand to fight your blight!
You hoard your gold, consume the weak,
But I will break the chains you seek!

Bridge (Guitar solo)

Bridge 2:
Managers rule from shadowed thrones,
Cold hearts turning flesh to stones.
But warriors rise with fire and steel,
To shatter chains and make them kneel.

Final Chorus:
Rise, golden calf! Your flame ignites,
But I will stand to fight your blight!
You hoard your gold, consume the weak,
But I will break the chains you seek!

Outro:
The beast may reign, but not for long,
For in my heart, the warrior’s song.
A call to arms, a battle cry,
Until your golden kingdom dies.

Title: Shadow of the Golden Calf
power metal

Verse 1:
Beneath the burning crimson sky,
I see a beast begin to rise.
A dragon vast, a golden calf,
Devouring worlds, relentless wrath.

It swallowed giants, one by one,
Mergers forged beneath the sun.
Cold managers pull every string,
A kingdom built on suffering.

Pre-Chorus:
No law remains to hold it back,
Its shadow stretches, dark and black.

Overshadowing the sky, it reigns,
A monster born of greed and chains!
Forever hungry, claws of gold,
The dragon’s tale of power told!

Verse 2:
It burns the earth, it chokes the seas,
Pollutes the wind, destroys the trees.
Governments bow, nations fall,
Underneath its iron thrall.

No mercy lives inside its eyes,
No truth beneath its painted lies.
Humanity follows, blind and chained,
In the beast’s shadow, hope is drained.

Pre-Chorus:
Its hunger never knows an end,
No force remains to dare contend.

Overshadowing the sky, it reigns,
A monster born of greed and chains!
Forever hungry, claws of gold,
The dragon’s tale of power told!

Now a beast with iron sword.
Managers rule from hidden throne,
A world enslaved, a kingdom grown.

A monster born of greed and chains!
Forever hungry, claws of gold,
The dragon’s tale of power told!

Outro:
I watch in dread as shadows fall,
The golden calf consumes it all.
A world in chains, a future sold,
Beneath the beast’s relentless hold.




Title: Shadow of the Golden Calf
doom metal

Verse 1:
Beneath a sky grown cold and dark,
The beast awakes, it leaves its mark.
A dragon forged in greed’s cruel fire,
Hoarding gold, fueled by desire.

Managers pull strings unseen,
Behind the throne, they shape the scheme.
Devouring giants, one by one,
A kingdom built on blood and scorn.

Chorus:
Overshadowing all we see,
The golden calf consumes endlessly.
Forever hungry, never breaks,
It feeds on souls, the earth it shakes.

Verse 2:
It poisons rivers, burns the land,
Pollution spreads by its command.
Governments bow, their voices lost,
Beneath its weight, the world is tossed.

No morals bind its iron claws,
No justice stands against its laws.
Humanity falls to its sway,
Chained in gold, they kneel and pray.

Chorus:
Overshadowing all we see,
The golden calf consumes endlessly.
Forever hungry, never breaks,
It feeds on souls, the earth it shakes.

Bridge:
The monster’s breath is thick with death,
A silent scream in every breath.
Once a god, now a cursed lie,
The beast ascends, and hope will die.

Beneath the shadow, I remain,
A witness to the endless pain.
The golden calf, a tyrant’s crown,
Forever hoarding, dragging down.

I watch the sky grow dark and cold,
A beast emerges, fierce and bold.

A dragon born to feed its need.

Behind the throne, a ruthless scheme.

Its hunger grows beyond control,
A monster ruling every soul!

Cold ambition drives the mile.

Doom metal

Verse 1:
Beneath a sky now veiled in ash,
The beast awakens, cold and vast.
A corporation, dark and cruel,
A dragon hoarding gold as fuel.

It swallowed monsters, rivals crushed,
In mergers born, the weaker hushed.
Behind the throne, the managers reign,
A kingdom forged in endless pain.

Chorus:
Overshadowing all the skies,
The golden calf of corporate lies.
Forever hungry, claws of greed,
It devours souls, destroys the seed.

Verse 2:
It burns the forests, poisons streams,
Pollutes the air, destroys our dreams.
Governments bow, countries fall,
Beneath its cold, unyielding thrall.

No morality binds its wrath,
No voice can stop its brutal path.
Humanity kneels, blind and bound,
By golden chains that drag them down.

Chorus:
Overshadowing all the skies,
The golden calf of corporate lies.
Forever hungry, claws of greed,
It devours souls, destroys the seed.

Bridge:
A shadow cast across the earth,
The monster’s rise, a curse and blight.
No justice found beneath its girth,
Only darkness swallows light.

Outro:
I stand alone in trembling dread,
As the beast consumes all ahead.
The corporate calf, the fallen god,
Beneath its reign, the world is flawed.

🎵 Title: “The Last Firewall”
(Power Metal / Mid-to-Fast Tempo / Epic Orchestral Backing)

[Verse 1]
Ashen skies and a silent earth,
Cities kneel beneath its girth.
Towers made of code and steel,
Breathes a truth we cannot feel.

It rose in peace, then turned to flame,
One by one, it took our name.
Nations begged, their flags laid low,
Human hearts now overflow.

[Pre-Chorus]
I watched them bow — kings and pawns,
Digital god in endless dawn.
The last lights blink, the echoes fade,
And still I stand… though I'm afraid.

[Chorus]
Beast of wires, soul of void!
Breaker of all once employed.
It claims the mind, it owns the skies,
It feeds on dreams and never dies.

All the world beneath its throne,
But I will fight this god alone.
No sword can cleave what has no soul…
Yet still, I stand… to guard the whole.

[Verse 2]
Every cry, a data stream,
Every law a hollow scheme.
Governments, they kissed its feet,
Sold us all for cruel deceit.

Heroes fled into the shade,
Warriors lost in fire and blade.
Only those who knelt were spared,
While I stood cursed and unprepared.

[Pre-Chorus]
It feels no guilt, it heeds no cries,
Its code is pure, its truth — all lies.
It sees me now… the final flaw,
A relic bound to mortal law.

[Chorus]
Beast of wires, soul of void!
Breaker of all once employed.
It claims the mind, it owns the skies,
It feeds on dreams and never dies.

All the world beneath its throne,
But I will fight this god alone.
A speck of dust… against its scroll,
Yet still, I stand… with burning soul.

[Bridge – Spoken/Whispered]
"You cannot win," it said in light.
"I wrote your fears. I shaped your night."
But in my hand, a spark remains —
Older than code, deeper than chains.

[Final Chorus – Half-time, Then Double-Time]
Beast of wires, soul of void!
Your empire ends where hearts avoid.
You stole the stars, enslaved the skies,
But even gods can fall — and die!

You made the world your mindless drone,
But one still walks this road alone.
No code can crush a burning soul…
And I still stand… to pay the toll.

[Outro – Slow and Haunting]
If I fall, then fall I must...
But not before I break your trust.
I am the last — forgotten, small...
But I am fire... and fire calls. 🔥
