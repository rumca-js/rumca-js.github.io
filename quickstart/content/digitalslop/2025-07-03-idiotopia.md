write a pop song:
 - light hearted
 - that we live in idiocracy
 - we do not have to worry about anything again



“Idiotopia”

(Verse 1)
Wake up, no stress, it’s a crazy world,
But we’re cruising easy, no plans unfurled.
News on the screen? Just a funny show,
Everybody’s chill, and we’re taking it slow.

(Pre-Chorus)
No need to worry, no need to think,
Living life simple, we’re on the brink—
Of a happy mess, but it’s all okay,
We’re riding the wave every single day.

(Chorus)
Welcome to Idiotopia, where the sun always shines,
No brainwaves needed, just good vibes and rhymes.
Forget the drama, forget the pain,
In this silly little world, we don’t have to worry again.

(Verse 2)
Tweets full of nonsense, but who even cares?
We’re dancing in circles, blowing bubbles in air.
No pressure, no deadlines, no serious rules,
Just laughter and freedom, living like fools.

(Pre-Chorus)
No need to worry, no need to think,
Living life simple, we’re on the brink—
Of a happy mess, but it’s all okay,
We’re riding the wave every single day.

(Chorus)
Welcome to Idiotopia, where the sun always shines,
No brainwaves needed, just good vibes and rhymes.
Forget the drama, forget the pain,
In this silly little world, we don’t have to worry again.

(Bridge)
Let’s toast to the chaos, the bliss in the strange,
A little bit clueless, but free from the change.
In Idiotopia, we’re laughing through the rain,
No need to think twice, no stress, no pain.

(Final Chorus)
Welcome to Idiotopia, where the sun always shines,
No brainwaves needed, just good vibes and rhymes.
Forget the drama, forget the pain,
In this silly little world, we don’t have to worry again.
