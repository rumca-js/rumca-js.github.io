Genre: Industrial Rock â€” harsh, mechanical, anti-human

[Intro â€“ whispered, through static]
I didnâ€™t write this.
You didnâ€™t read it.
They did.

[Verse 1 â€“ pounding drums, distorted guitars]
Words on a screen, born in the wire,
No sweat, no pain, no spark, no fire.
Lyrics built from recycled lies,
Spat out clean where the feeling dies.

Judged by code, sliced by math,
Run it through the simulation path.
No ears, no tears, no heart to shatter â€”
Just numbers telling what should matter.

[Pre-Chorus â€“ tense, mechanical synths rising]
Play it safe, loop it fast,
Make it short, hope it lasts.
This is art in a cage of chrome,
Where every song sounds like a dial tone.

[Chorus â€“ loud, distorted, furious]
ðŸŽ¶ Written by bots, performed for ghosts,
Ranked and scanned by whatâ€™s liked most.
No soul, no voice, no rot, no rust â€”
Just plastic flesh and a screen to trust.
Analyzed deep, down to the beat,
Bleached and bland and painfully neat.
Youâ€™re not the listener â€” just the plot,
And every note?
Itâ€™s just a bot. ðŸŽ¶

[Verse 2 â€“ heavier guitars, more aggression]
Feedback loops in a glass parade,
Clickbait hooks in a minor grade.
Everything screams in prefab style,
Dead on arrival, dressed in a smile.

Charts decide what we pretend to feel,
Recycled moods we fake as real.
Itâ€™s all the same in a different skin â€”
Built to scroll, but never dig in.

[Bridge â€“ low, spoken, through radio distortion]
Once we sang to bleed,
Now we sing to trend.
Once we broke the rules,
Now we auto-blend.

[Breakdown â€“ instrumental chaos, glitching noises, feedback]
glitching vocal layers: "not real... not real... not real..."
heavy static, metallic crashes, echoing fragments of the chorus

[Final Chorus â€“ screaming, breaking through distortion]
ðŸŽ¶ Written by bots, sold as truth,
No breath, no rage, no wasted youth.
You hum along, but you donâ€™t hear â€”
Itâ€™s just machine dust in your ear.
Rated high, then tossed and shot,
Another trend that you forgot.
You think itâ€™s yours â€” but itâ€™s not.
Itâ€™s just a bot.
JUST A BOT.
JUST. A. BOT. ðŸŽ¶
