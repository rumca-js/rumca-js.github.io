write a goth metal song about a girl:
 - her manager is is pale white, like a dracula
 - appears to never sleep
 - approaches her even during the night
 - drains power
 - enchanting
 - has power over people (and over her)
 - she hates him, but also loves him
 - can't resist him

you can mix more dracula vibes, terminology, into the song


“Midnight’s Veil” (LinkedIn Shadows)

[Goth metal, goth rock, female sopran voice, high]

(Verse 1)
His profile’s flawless — LinkedIn king,
Endless posts, success they sing.
Sleepless demon in my feed,
Dragging me down, feeding greed.

Inbox floods with midnight calls,
Performance metrics, coldest walls.
He watches through the webcam’s glow,
A vampire in my status quo.

(Pre-Chorus)
His emails drip like venom’s art,
A poison piercing through my heart.

(Chorus)
Midnight’s veil, I’m trapped in scrolls,
Endless meetings, broken goals.
I hate his grip, but crave his bite,
Slave to spreadsheets in the night.
He steals my breath with every ping,
A cursed dance beneath his wing.

(Verse 2)
Dashboard lights my fading spark,
KPIs that tear apart.
No rest when the workday ends,
His shadow looms — it never bends.

Endless calls with frozen smiles,
Tied to contracts, endless trials.
I rage inside, I want to flee,
But his pull won’t set me free.

(Pre-Chorus)
His LinkedIn boasts, a mask so thin,
Behind it hides the thirst within.

(Chorus)
Midnight’s veil, I’m trapped in scrolls,
Endless meetings, broken goals.
I hate his grip, but crave his bite,
Slave to spreadsheets in the night.
He steals my breath with every ping,
A cursed dance beneath his wing.

(Bridge)
Weekly reports, my blood runs cold,
His power grows, my soul is sold.
No daylight breaks this iron screen,
I’m lost inside the corporate machine.

(Breakdown - growled)
Boss of shadows, king of lies,
Feeds on fear and silent cries.
Signed my life to his regime —
Caught forever in this dream.

(Final Chorus)
Midnight’s veil, I’m trapped in scrolls,
Endless meetings, broken goals.
I hate his grip, but crave his bite,
Slave to spreadsheets in the night.
He steals my breath with every ping,
A cursed dance beneath his wing.

(Outro)
LinkedIn king with endless might —
I’m his captive, lost in night.
