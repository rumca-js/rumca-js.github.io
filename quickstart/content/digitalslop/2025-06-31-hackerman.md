ðŸŽµ "Hackerman"
Genre: Synthwave / Cyberpunk Anthem
By: ChatGPT

[Verse 1]
In a room lit by neon blue
Black screen, white text coming through
Fingers flying like a ghost in code
Heâ€™s the legend in stealth mode

Whispers echo in the datastream
He rides the shell like a lucid dream
Scripting logic, sharp like flame
Every port scan knows his name

[Chorus]
Hackerman â€” terminal knight
Breaking through the firewalls, into the night
Hackerman â€” runs on the line
Portals open wide, bending space and time
Heâ€™s dodging NSA's synthetic lies
Reclaiming data where the silence cries
Hackerman â€” no trace, no shame
Helping users while he hides his name

[Verse 2]
Encrypted maps on ancient drives
He finds the ghosts that kept alive
Data lost in server tombs
He brings it back from digital gloom

Quantum gateways, hidden zones
He surfs the darknet all alone
Yet messages ping from distant crews
He's part of something bigger too

[Bridge] (spoken with synth beat)
"Port 8080â€™s bleeding,
Kill the daemon, rewrite the meaning.
Firewallâ€™s up? â€” not for long.
My code is tight. My will is strong."

[Chorus]
Hackerman â€” wires and light
Ghost in the circuit, born to fight
Hackerman â€” echo of fate
Opening ports, sealing userâ€™s gate
Outruns viruses with mirrored eyes
Breaking traps laid by suits in ties
Hackerman â€” the myth, the man
Unseen savior with a terminal plan

[Outro]
So if your system starts to slow
And shadows flicker in the flow
Type #help â€” and wait, don't fear
You might just hear him whisper nearâ€¦

Hackerman... is always here.
