 - it is the only bastion of free speech

 - can make your day
 - cats are so nice, babies to, etc

"Meme World Magic"

(Verse 1)
Scrolling through my phone, a world so bright,
Memes hit my feed, everything’s alright,
Laughter’s loud, and the vibes are free,
In this digital sea, it’s the place to be.

(Pre-Chorus)
No rules, no walls, just pure delight,
A pixel playground shining through the night,
From cats in hats to babies who coo,
Memes bring the sunshine right to you.

(Chorus)
Meme world magic, the only free speech,
Where smiles grow bigger with every reach,
It can make your day, just a little spark,
Turning up the joy when life gets dark.

(Verse 2)
Grumpy cats stare with their royal sass,
Babies giggle like pure class,
Every meme’s a little ray of hope,
A secret handshake, a universal joke.

(Pre-Chorus)
No filters needed, just heart and soul,
Memes are the stories that make us whole,
From viral dances to clever rhymes,
They lift us up, one laugh at a time.

(Chorus)
Meme world magic, the only free speech,
Where smiles grow bigger with every reach,
It can make your day, just a little spark,
Turning up the joy when life gets dark.

(Bridge)
So here’s to the memes that set us free,
A colorful, wild, sweet symphony,
In cats and babies, in laughs we trust,
A digital world where kindness is a must.

(Chorus)
Meme world magic, the only free speech,
Where smiles grow bigger with every reach,
It can make your day, just a little spark,
Turning up the joy when life gets dark.

(Outro)
Keep those memes coming, don’t ever stop,
In a world so crazy, they’re the cream of the crop,
Cats, babies, and laughter all combined,
In meme world magic, happiness you’ll find.
