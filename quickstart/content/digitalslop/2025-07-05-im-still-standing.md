🍸 "Still Here Sippin'"

(Upbeat pop, piano-driven, feel-good groove)
[Verse 1]

Woke up this morning, head kinda heavy
Last night’s a blur, but I’m still steady
Pour me another, don’t need no cure
I’m a little tipsy, but my heart’s so pure

Friends all laughing, saying I’m a mess
But I’m just dancing in my own success
Bottle in hand, I’m feeling fine
A little crazy, but this life is mine
[Pre-Chorus]

Yeah, the world’s spinning, but I’m holding tight
Through the ups and downs, I’m still alright
[Chorus]

🎶
I’m still here sippin’, yeah, I’m still standing
Raise my glass up high, yeah, life’s demanding
Through the haze and the night, I keep on dancing
I’m still here sippin’, yeah, I’m still standing! 🎶
[Verse 2]

Bar stools callin’, neon lights glow
I’ve got stories only the bottles know
Laugh lines growing from the late night cheers
Living loud and proud, no room for fears

Some say I’m reckless, I say I’m free
Just a happy man in a world of dreams
No regrets, just a wild ride
With my drink in hand, I’m on my side
[Pre-Chorus]

Yeah, the world’s spinning, but I’m holding tight
Through the ups and downs, I’m still alright
[Chorus]

🎶
I’m still here sippin’, yeah, I’m still standing
Raise my glass up high, yeah, life’s demanding
Through the haze and the night, I keep on dancing
I’m still here sippin’, yeah, I’m still standing! 🎶
[Bridge]

Here’s to the nights we barely recall
And the mornings we made it through it all
A little tipsy, but feeling grand
Cheers to life, I still stand!
[Chorus]

🎶
I’m still here sippin’, yeah, I’m still standing
Raise my glass up high, yeah, life’s demanding
Through the haze and the night, I keep on dancing
I’m still here sippin’, yeah, I’m still standing! 🎶
[Outro]

Still standing, still dancing
Still here sippin’ — life’s enchanting!

🍻 "Still Here, Still Buzzin'"

(Bright piano-driven pop with a bounce)
[Verse 1]

I used to wake up early, drag myself to work
Boss was breathing down my neck, always a jerk
Now the alarm clock’s silent, no more 9 to 5
I’m living life easy — man, I feel alive

Had a problem with my wife, she walked right out the door
Said, “Good luck with your drinking,” but I’m not keeping score
No more fights or sleepless nights, I’m finally free
Pour another round — this one’s just for me
[Pre-Chorus]

Yeah, I’ve been down, but I’m rising again
Got my bottle in hand and a brand new plan
[Chorus]

🎶
I’m still here, still buzzin’, and I’m still standing
No more work, no more worries demanding
She’s gone and my problems are all fading away
I can drink all day — yeah, I’m here to stay! 🎶
[Verse 2]

Used to stress over deadlines, now I stress over what’s next to drink
Got no boss, no drama, just time to think
Friends say “Get it together,” but I just smile and say,
“I’m still standing strong — and I’m gonna stay this way”
[Pre-Chorus]

Yeah, I’ve been down, but I’m rising again
Got my bottle in hand and a brand new plan
[Chorus]

🎶
I’m still here, still buzzin’, and I’m still standing
No more work, no more worries demanding
She’s gone and my problems are all fading away
I can drink all day — yeah, I’m here to stay! 🎶
[Bridge]

Raise your glass if you’ve lost a little sleep
If the past was rough but the future’s sweet
No more early mornings, no more tears to cry
Just me and my bottle under an open sky
[Chorus]

🎶
I’m still here, still buzzin’, and I’m still standing
No more work, no more worries demanding
She’s gone and my problems are all fading away
I can drink all day — yeah, I’m here to stay! 🎶
[Outro]

Still buzzin’, still standing — life’s a little funny
But I’m happy just here with my bottle and my money!
