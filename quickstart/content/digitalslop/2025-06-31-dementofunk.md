"One Minute Mind"
dark pop

Verse 1:
I’m a shadow drifting, can’t stay still
Lazy bones with a restless will
Bored so quick, I flip the page
Nothing sticks, I disengage

Pre-Chorus:
Give me the summary, cut it short
Don’t waste my time, I’m out the door
Too tired to care, too quick to switch
I’m running wild in this glitch

Chorus:
One minute mind, can’t stay too long
Need it fast, can’t play along
I’m easily bored, always demanding
Don’t ask me to change, I’m not expanding

Verse 2:
Interest fades like a flickering light
I chase distractions through the night
I’m not broken, just out of tune
Lazy heart, I’m immune

Pre-Chorus:
Give me the summary, cut it short
Don’t waste my time, I’m out the door
Too tired to care, too quick to switch
I’m running wild in this glitch

Chorus:
One minute mind, can’t stay too long
Need it fast, can’t play along
I’m easily bored, always demanding
Don’t ask me to change, I’m not expanding

Bridge:
You say grow up, you say behave
I’m fine right here, in my lazy cave
No patience for your endless fight
I’ll burn my way in this restless night

Chorus:
One minute mind, can’t stay too long
Need it fast, can’t play along
I’m easily bored, always demanding
Don’t ask me to change, I’m not expanding

Outro:
Lazy soul in a restless world
I’m not your project, I’m not your girl



"Lazy Groove"
funk

[Verse 1]
I’m sittin’ back, don’t wanna try
Got no interest, and I don’t know why
One minute focus, then I’m gone
Need the short story, keep it on

[Pre-Chorus]
TL;DR, that’s how I roll
Quick and easy, no deep soul
Don’t ask me to change my ways
I’m chillin’ here with my lazy ass

[Chorus]
I’m lazy, yeah, I’m out of line
Easily bored, but I’m feelin’ fine
Demanding all, want it quick
One minute’s all I ever pick

[Verse 2]
Jumpin’ topics like a funky beat
Never slow down, never repeat
Can’t stay long on just one track
But I’m alright, I’m never lookin’ back

[Pre-Chorus]
TL;DR, that’s how I roll
Quick and easy, no deep soul
Don’t ask me to change my ways
I’m chillin’ here with my lazy ass

[Chorus]
I’m lazy, yeah, I’m out of line
Easily bored, but I’m feelin’ fine
Demanding all, want it quick
One minute’s all I ever pick

[Bridge]
No deep dives, no heavy plans
Just a laid-back, easy jam
If it’s too long, I’m out the door
I want the funk, but never more

[Chorus]
I’m lazy, yeah, I’m out of line
Easily bored, but I’m feelin’ fine
Demanding all, want it quick
One minute’s all I ever pick

[Outro]
Lazy groove, that’s my style
Stick around, just for a while
