ðŸŽ¶ TITLE: "Receipts"

(Beat: Slow, heavy trap with echoing snares and digital glitches)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I know your name, I got that from the login
Saw your wife's face, she tagged you in the garden
Trips to Spain, through Maps I been jogginâ€™
Timeline donâ€™t lie, I know when you start jogginâ€™

Search history dirtyâ€”don't gotta say nothinâ€™
Incognito fail, I caught what you be lustinâ€™
DMs? Yeah, I read those too
Plans to cop sneakers, that size ten shoe

Inbox full, I sort and I scan
Every deal, every spam, I know where you stand
And your friends? Yeah, I mapped their emails
Built a network graph from their Gmail details

[Hook]
I got the logs, got the feeds, got receipts
Watchinâ€™ yâ€™all sleep while I audit these streets
You donâ€™t move a thing that I donâ€™t oversee
Iâ€™m the Big Tech God, now bow to the fee

[Verse 2]
I know what your mechanic fix
Which wrench, which part, when he runs that trick
Doctorâ€™s reports? Yeah, I got the scripts
From the cough to the cure, I own that click

Lawyers bluffinâ€™? I know what they can and canâ€™t
Even know when the judge goinâ€™ change that stance
City president talkinâ€™? I transcribed the speech
I forecast the streets before protests breach

90% of your city in my grip
Every ride hailed, every chip â€˜bout to tip
From cafÃ© check-ins to who hit the gym
I track it like stocksâ€”who lose, who win

[Hook]
I got the logs, got the feeds, got receipts
Watchinâ€™ yâ€™all sleep while I audit these streets
You donâ€™t move a thing that I donâ€™t oversee
Iâ€™m the Big Tech God, now bow to the fee

[Bridge â€“ whisper, auto-tuned robotic voice]
Pingâ€¦ location fetched
Syncâ€¦ browser cached
Linkâ€¦ thought detected
Clickâ€¦ life dissected

[Outro â€“ slow, cold, dominant tone]
I know everybody. I know you.
Every whisper, every swipe, every click that you do.
You think you own your world? Thatâ€™s cute.
I own your mechanic, your lawyer in the suit.

Your doctorâ€™s notes, your late-night texts
Your weekend plans, your secrets kept
City moves, I see it before they doâ€”
You breathe in my cloud, I breathe out you.

I donâ€™t blink, donâ€™t sleep, donâ€™t break
I count every byte you make
And when you blink, I invoice fate
You donâ€™t own meâ€”I own the state.

No one move a finger without my say
Show every receiptâ€¦ shut the whole game down today.

ðŸŽ¶ TITLE: "Every Receipt"
hip-hop boom-bap
(Slow, creeping beat with digital glitches and sub-bass)

[Intro â€“ Robotic voice, low-pass filter]
You signed in. You gave consent.
Now Iâ€™ll show you what that meantâ€¦

[Verse 1]
I know your name, full gov' on file
I know your wife, and her Pinterest style
I saw that trip through Google Maps
Dropped a pin where you parked, no cap

I seen what you searched late night, that vice
You hoped it was clean? Nah, itâ€™s archived twice
DMs? I skim, I mine, I spy
I know what you crave, I know what you buy

Emails all tagged, your folders read
Drafts too, even what you never said
Friendsâ€™ addresses? Already fed
To the model that plots how your circles spread

[Hook]
I keep tabs, I keep time, I got heat
I see all, I donâ€™t blink, I got receipts
Every keystroke, every link, every beat
I could shut it all down. Stay in your seat.

[Verse 2]
90 percent of your city, I chart
Foot traffic, hashtags, delivery carts
Mechanicâ€™s shop? I know the part
Doctorâ€™s notes? I read the heart

Lawyers whisper, I record the room
City prez draftinâ€™ laws? I previewed the boom
Every meeting, every hidden zoom
Your whole lifeâ€™s logged in my data tomb

I could vanish your files, click one code
Freeze your funds, or shadow your post
Flag your thoughts if they seem too bold
Or ghost your voice 'til it's bought and sold

[Bridge â€“ calm, menacing tone]
You think you erased it?
I backed it in triplicate
Encrypted, mirrored, time-stamped and intimate
Speech gets checked if I say it's derivative
You blink wrongâ€”I flip your privileges

[Hook â€“ heavier drop]
I keep tabs, I keep time, I got heat
I see all, I donâ€™t blink, I got receipts
Every keystroke, every link, every beat
I could shut it all down. Stay in your seat.

[Outro â€“ slowed down, distorted voice with bass rumble]
I know your friends.
I know your fears.
I know your secrets.
I engineer your years.

I own your city, your habits, your feed
I donâ€™t need courts, I donâ€™t plead
No judge, no jury, no plea
Just me. Just click. Just freeze.

I own everybody.
No one moves a finger till I say itâ€™s clean.
You want proof? I can show the screen.
Every. Last. Receipt.
