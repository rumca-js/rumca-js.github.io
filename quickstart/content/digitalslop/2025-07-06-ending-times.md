write a symphonic power metal song about:
 - unknown mage ascends from heaven (seen as dove at first)
 - where he steps plants grow
 - knows all magical spells
 - fights with machine beasts, antichrist
 - where the machine steps, the earth rots, turns to wires
 - all people are dead. it is last fight of the divine
 - christianity motifs
 - the mage contains staff of infinite light
 - the mage chants holy chants, gets eaten
 - the machine turns into krzaki
 - flowers glow, no one to witness end of life
 - sun fades, closes
 - the last chant of mage reset humans into perfect humans


🕊️ “The Last Chant of the Mage Divine” 🕊️

(Symphonic Power Metal Epic)

[Prologue – Orchestral Prelude, Choir Whispering in Latin:]

    "Fiat lux… Gloria… Deus ultimus..."
    (Let there be light… Glory… The final God…)

[Verse 1] – Soft, celestial intro
A dove descends on ashen skies,
No wind, no flame—just silent cries.
Where he steps, the green returns,
In dead men's fields, the blessing burns.

[Verse 2] – Rising tempo
His cloak aglow, his eyes ablaze,
The unknown mage from heaven’s maze.
He speaks the tongue of every star,
He knows all spells from near and far.

[Pre-Chorus] – Choir-backed power surge

    "Lux aeterna, lux divina!"
    With staff of light, he parts the night.
    "Vincit Deus per incantationem!"
    The holy chants begin the fight.

[Chorus] – Triumphant, soaring melody
⚔️ This is the last war, the divine crusade,
Machine against soul in the light’s cascade!
The earth is rotting where circuits crawl,
But heaven's fire will burn them all!
🌿 One final mage, with holy flame,
To cleanse the world and end the game.

[Verse 3] – Machine hellscape
The Machine Beast walks in blight and wire,
Its breath is steam, its heart’s a fire.
The Antichrist with steel-bound skin,
Brings death to flesh, to love, to sin.

[Verse 4] – Melancholy bridge
All are gone, the sky is red,
Only corpses dream the dead.
No choir sings, no bells remain—
Only the Mage in godless rain.

[Pre-Chorus] – Orchestral build, intensifying

    "Adveniat regnum tuum...
    Fiat voluntas tua…"

His chants rise up, the world is torn,
The staff ignites with sacred storm.

[Chorus] – Stronger, darker tone
⚔️ This is the last war, the sacred vow,
No man remains to witness now.
Machine to krzaki, metal to thorn,
The serpent dies where truth is born.
🌸 Flowers bloom in glowing grace,
On a forgotten battlefield’s face.

[Bridge – Slow, haunting section]
The mage is eaten, flesh to void,
The Machine laughs, the stars destroyed.
But from within, the song was cast—
The final chant, the holy blast.

    "Resetare animam humanam…
    Per crucem, per flammam..."

[Final Chorus] – Majestic, fading into sorrow
🌞 The sun is closing, light undone,
No witness left beneath this sun.
But from his death, a spark remains,
To heal the blood, to cleanse the chains.
👤 The last chant echoes, time unwinds—
Humanity reborn, perfected minds.

[Outro – Solo flute, fading into silence]
(Flowers glow. Winds whisper. No one sees.)

    "Amen… amen…"
