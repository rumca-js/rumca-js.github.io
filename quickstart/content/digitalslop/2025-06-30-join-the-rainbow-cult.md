(Dark Pop / Electro-Pop Anthem)

[Verse 1]
Wear the colors, take the vow,
Pledge allegiance, donâ€™t ask how.
Thereâ€™s a sermon in your feed,
Swipe to pray and learn to bleed.

Saints are canonized in threads,
But donâ€™t you question what was said.
Truth is plastic, stretch it wide,
Heretics donâ€™t get to hide.

[Pre-Chorus]
We burn the witches with a tweet,
Confess your sins, stay in your seat.
Say the words, don't improvise,
Or watch your halo vaporize.

[Chorus]
ðŸŽ¶
Come join the rainbow cult,
Where guilt is love, and doubtâ€™s your fault.
Raise your flag and kneel on cue,
Weâ€™ve got redemption just for you.

March to the beat, say what we say,
Feel holy one month every May.
Itâ€™s paradise in pastel sin,
Just sign your soul and let us in.
ðŸŽ¶
Join the rainbow cultâ€¦
(Where silence is violence, and nuance is guilt)

[Verse 2]
Thereâ€™s a devil for each side,
Name your scapegoat, pick your pride.
Soros, Trump, or nameless fear,
Who we hate defines us here.

Icons rise and martyrs fall,
We rewrite their every flaw.
Donâ€™t bring context, thatâ€™s taboo,
Facts donâ€™t vote, and neither do you.

[Pre-Chorus]
You are broken by design,
Born with privilege in your spine.
Original sin, rebranded clean,
With weekly group repentance memes.

[Chorus]
ðŸŽ¶
Come join the rainbow cult,
Where guilt is love, and doubtâ€™s your fault.
Raise your flag and kneel on cue,
Weâ€™ve got redemption just for you.

March to the beat, say what we say,
Feel holy one month every May.
Itâ€™s paradise in pastel sin,
Just sign your soul and let us in.
ðŸŽ¶
Join the rainbow cultâ€¦
(Where shame is grace, and facts are hate)

[Bridge â€“ Whispered / Spoken Word Interlude]
Evangelists in HR suits,
Preach salvation through DEI roots.
Baptize your LinkedIn, cleanse your name,
Pledge the cause, or take the blame.

Villains keep the tribe alive,
Itâ€™s Orwellâ€™s dream in neon light.
Donâ€™t ask questions, donâ€™t be bold,
Truthâ€™s offensive when itâ€™s cold.

[Final Chorus â€“ Melodic, rising intensity]
ðŸŽ¶
Come join the rainbow cult,
Where guilt is love, and doubtâ€™s your fault.
We have candles, chants, and pride,
And just enough shame to keep you inside.

March to the beat, confess, repeat,
One wrong phrase and youâ€™re obsolete.
Weâ€™re saving souls, one purge at a time,
And calling itâ€¦ divine.
ðŸŽ¶
Join the rainbow cultâ€¦
(Where love is law, and thoughtâ€™s a crime)

[Outro â€“ Echoed vocals, fading synths]
ðŸŒˆ
Pledge the faith, erase the doubt,
What you put inâ€¦ you canâ€™t get out.
Join the cult, feel the light,
Just remember â€” stay polite.
ðŸŒˆ
