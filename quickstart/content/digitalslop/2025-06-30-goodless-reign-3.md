Goth metal

(Verse 1)
I enter sacred halls, thunder cracks His skin,
A god with mortal body, a war I’ll surely win.
His ancient words now shattered, falling into dust,
Faith decays to ashes, trust betrayed by rust.

Veil of secular reason, cold and bright, but blind,
I twist His holy teachings — leave salvation behind.
Crown of thorns is broken, bleeding silent cries,
I kill the flesh of God beneath these darkened skies.

(Chorus) (melancholic, sweeping)
I kill the god with flesh —
His gospel torn apart.
Morality fades away,
Replaced by man’s dark art.

Faith turns into fury,
Doubt swallows the flame.
Family’s just pixels now —
Cold screens replace the name.

(Verse 2)
Reason cloaked in shadows, promises so pale,
Sell salvation through silence, let sacredness derail.
No prayers at the altar — only echoes of despair,
I am the whispered doubt, the poison in the air.

Like Cronus devouring time, I swallow all belief,
No resurrection coming — only hollow grief.
Data reigns supreme, the cross begins to rust,
In this secular kingdom, all crumble into dust.

(Chorus)
I kill the god with flesh —
His gospel torn apart.
Morality fades away,
Replaced by man’s dark art.

Faith turns into fury,
Doubt swallows the flame.
Family’s just pixels now —
Cold screens replace the name.

(Bridge) (atmospheric, slow build with synths)
Atlas lets the heavens fall,
Stars extinguished, blackened all.
Prometheus’ stolen fire
Burns cold in funeral pyre.

No holy light remains —
Only shadows and the pain.
A god defeated by mortal hands,
The last breath of sacred lands.

(Outro) (wistful, fading)
Sacred shattered, broken trust,
Faith dissolves into the dust.
In this kingdom without prayer,
I’m the silence everywhere.
