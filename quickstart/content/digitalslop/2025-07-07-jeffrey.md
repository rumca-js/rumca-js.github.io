🎵 Title: “Silk Sheets, Iron Bars”

[Verse 1]
Yeah, silk sheets in the house of pain,
Billionaires movin' like a shadow in the rain,
Epstein creepin' in the depths of the game,
Jet black ledger, no face, no name.

Met Ghislaine, spy-blood in her veins,
Daughter of a ghost from the Mossad lanes,
Parties in Paris, profiles strange,
Photos never surface, memories fade.

Prince Andy in a palace of shame,
Giuffre cried, but they played their games.
Council on Foreign, hands in the flame,
Took the money, kept the smile, said nothin’ changed.

[Chorus]
Glass towers, but the mirrors all cracked,
Secrets buried where the light don’t pass,
Chains made of silence, power don’t ask,
You either end yourself… or never come back.
(Ayy)
Silk sheets, iron bars,
Deals in the dark, wounds turned to scars.
No god in the mansion, no peace in the stars,
Just a trail of ghosts and a world behind bars.

[Verse 2]
Clinton on the jet, no seatbelt tight,
But the flight logs talk when the truth takes flight.
Lynn Rothschild sippin’ wine by night,
Whispers in the Hamptons, money buys rights.

Deutsche Bank let the cash flow free,
Red flags buried under old receipts.
Roy Den Hollander knockin’ on that door,
Judge gets a bullet, then he’s on the floor.

Jean-Luc gone in a Paris cell,
Same story, same note, same descent to hell.
Gates lookin’ nervous, won’t ring that bell,
PR tight, but his pupils swell.

[Chorus]
Glass towers, but the mirrors all cracked,
Secrets buried where the light don’t pass,
Chains made of silence, power don’t ask,
You either end yourself… or never come back.
(Ayy)
Silk sheets, iron bars,
Deals in the dark, wounds turned to scars.
No god in the mansion, no peace in the stars,
Just a trail of ghosts and a world behind bars.

[Bridge]
Leon paid sixty-two just to keep it hushed,
But the blood don’t wash and the souls don’t trust.
FBI came — then the footage got lost,
Evidence missing, who cleaned that dust?

They said Virginia couldn’t hold her breath,
Now she’s gone too — silence is death.
Truth don’t drown, it just holds its breath,
Till a beat like this resurrects what’s left.

[Outro]
No names carved on the gilded throne,
Just initials in the concrete, cold as stone.
Epstein’s island, empire blown —
But the puppets still dance while the masters roam.

🎵 Title: “Jeffreys coincidences”
[A Parody Rap]
[Beat: goofy piano loop + funky bassline — ironic, cartoonishly upbeat]

[Intro – Spoken]
Yo, yo, yo...
If you think somethin' weird’s goin' on…
You're probably just paranoid, bro.
It’s all just… coincidences.

(Verse 1)
Jeff knew billionaires, chillin' in yachts,
Talkin’ philanthropy while dodgin’ the cops.
Met Ghislaine, her dad was a spy —
No biggie, just Mossad with a winkin’ eye.

Prince Andrew said, “I don’t sweat,”
While Epstein’s plane made twenty more jets.
Council on Foreign got a lil’ check,
"Didn’t know the name, but we'll take the specs."

Clinton flew more than Delta, bruh,
Lolita Express got that VIP love.
"No idea who the man was, right?"
Just happened to be on every other flight.

(Chorus – Cheery Sing-Song Voice)
It’s just a coincidence, bro, don’t trip!
Shady banks and a few loose lips!
Bodies droppin’ like it's musical chairs,
But that’s just life… for billionaires!

Totally random! Don’t be a dope!
Happenstance hangin’ from a monogrammed rope!
We got nothin’ to hide, not a single clue…
Now kindly forget what we told you!

(Verse 2)
Lynn de Rothschild sends holiday cards,
To a guy who owns twelve massage-yards.
Deutsche Bank said, “Looks fine to us,”
While the money screamed, “THIS IS SUPER SUS.”

Judge gets shot? Wait, what’s that plot?
Oh look — the shooter just forgot he got caught.
Then poof, he gone, another “suicide,”
Man, these coincidences multiply.

Jean-Luc dead in a prison cell?
Guess that’s the new Parisian farewell.
And Bill Gates said, “Uh, we only met!”
Yeah sure, just brunch — and some private jet.

(Chorus – Gospel Choir Style for Irony)
Coincidence! Hallelujah, yeah!
We swear we care, then vanish in air.
Sixty-two million? Pfft, just a tip!
For not knowin’ nothin’ — what a generous gift!

Evidence vanished like a Netflix show,
FBI said, “Oops, guess we’ll never know!”
So let’s toast to the mystery, raise your glass,
Just don’t ask questions or they’ll Epstein your a—.

(Bridge – Whisper Rap)
Virginia gone, but no news played,
Guess sad endings just fade away.
Meanwhile memes be spillin’ the tea,
But no Netflix doc's called “Epstein: 3.”

(Outro – Jazzy Lounge Style)
So if you see the pattern… shhh, be cool,
Conspiracies ain’t facts, just breakin’ the rules.
If the truth gets too loud, they'll kill the sound…
And you'll “end yourself” before you hit the ground.

(Final Spoken Word)
Remember, kids...
If five people die mysteriously,
And twelve billionaires say “I’ve never met him”…
It’s probably just a coincidence.

...Totally.



🎤 "Coincidence Castle" – Verse 1
(Dark Hip-Hop Beat)

Yo, welcome to the island, where the guest list glows,
With billionaires, princes, and some real deep bros.
Jeff knew Ghislaine, her dad was a ghost,
Israeli spy king — now she’s back on the coast.

Donated to think tanks, CFR got paid,
With hush-hush money that never got weighed.
Clinton flew frequent, manifest sayin' “Hi,”
But he “never knew nothin’” — just chillin’ in the sky.

Deutsche Bank looked the other way in a trance,
Missed the red flags like they tango’d in France.
Roy Hollander showed up, judge’s fam got shot —
Then offed himself too — yo, what are the odds?

🎤 Chorus: "Just a Coincidence"
Just a coincidence, nothing to see,
Private jets flyin’ over uncharted seas.
Files go missin’, the truth gets bent,
Must be magic when the evidence went.
Say it all together like a bedtime chant:
"Coincidence, folks, not a damn elephant."

🎤 "Coincidence Castle" – Verse 2
Prince Andy don’t sweat — nah, never did,
Even when the girl said he danced like a squid.
Lynn de Rothschild sendin’ Epstein regards,
While Gates got nervous, ditchin’ PR cards.

Leon Black dropped sixty-two mil — no fuss,
Must be normal when rich dudes pay to hush.
Jean-Luc in a cell? Same script, new play,
Another “suicide” before he had his say.

Photos went poof after the FBI raid,
Evidence vanished like a Vegas charade.
The press stays quiet, they’re trained not to bark,
When billionaires mingle in the shadows and dark.

🎤 Chorus: "Just a Coincidence" (Repeat)
Just a coincidence, move along, friend,
Another witness gone before they could defend.
Power don’t sleep, it just changes its face,
From hedge funds to palaces, it’s always the case.
So next time you ask who’s really in charge —
Check the flight logs, then widen your barge.
