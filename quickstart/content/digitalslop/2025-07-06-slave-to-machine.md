 - I fallen so low
 - because of my actions
 - syn marnotrawny
 - I am the one to blame
 - I know my sins
 - I admit I was lazy and shortsighted

 - I thought I will be perfect
 - I put shining steel armour
 - ciruits replaced my vanes
 - oil replaced my blood

 - the armour began to rot
 - I am not my own
 - my soul aches
 - I am slave to the machine beast


Chorus
 - will I be forgiven?




ðŸ©¸ Slave to the Machine Beast ðŸ©¸
(Doom Gothic Song)

[Verse 1]
Iâ€™ve fallen so low, beneath the blackened ground
My deeds, like rust, corrode the hope I found
The prodigal returned, but not to open arms
Only shadows welcomed me, cold and without charm

[Verse 2]
It was my hand that lit the flame
No scapegoat here, I bear the blame
I dreamed of glory, blind and vain
Now I drown in iron shame

[Chorus]
I thought Iâ€™d rise, perfected steel
But flesh betrayed what mind could feel
My veins are wires, my blood is oil
The cost of prideâ€”a soul to spoil

[Verse 3]
I donned the armor, shining bright
Thought Iâ€™d outlast the mortal night
But metal rots, and circuits fail
No hollow crown can tip the scale

[Bridge]
I am not my own, no longer free
A slave bound tight in circuitry
The beast I built now owns my soul
Iâ€™ve lost myself to its control

[Verse 4]
I was lazy, shortsighted, blind
Ignored the rot that curled inside
I fed the gears with hopes and lies
Now it feasts while my spirit dies

[Chorus]
I thought Iâ€™d rise, perfected steel
But flesh betrayed what mind could feel
My veins are wires, my blood is oil
The cost of prideâ€”a soul to spoil

[Outro] (slow, fading into reverb)
I know my sins, I speak their names
Etched in rust, burned into shame
No savior waits, no rest, no peace
I serve beneath the machine beast...
