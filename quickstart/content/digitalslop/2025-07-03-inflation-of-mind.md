write a pop song about a person asking what is inflation, and cannot understand the concept




“What Is Inflation?”

(Verse 1)
I heard it on the news today,
They said prices rise and wallets pay,
But all these words just fly away,
Inflation’s like a mystery game.

(Pre-Chorus)
Why does my coffee cost more than before?
Why does my paycheck feel so poor?
I’m trying hard but can’t explain,
What’s behind this money pain?

(Chorus)
What is inflation? Can someone tell me?
Is it magic or just some mystery?
Why do things cost more and more each day?
I’m lost in numbers, what’s the way?
Oh, what is inflation? I can’t understand,
It’s slipping through my fingers like grains of sand.

(Verse 2)
They say it’s money chasing goods,
But does that mean it’s all misunderstood?
Prices rising, it’s out of hand,
Feels like I’m stuck in quicksand.

(Pre-Chorus)
I check my bills and I just sigh,
How did my money say goodbye?
Economics sounds so grand,
But I just want to understand.

(Chorus)
What is inflation? Can someone tell me?
Is it magic or just some mystery?
Why do things cost more and more each day?
I’m lost in numbers, what’s the way?
Oh, what is inflation? I can’t understand,
It’s slipping through my fingers like grains of sand.

(Bridge)
Is it a monster or a friend?
Will it ever meet its end?
I’m stuck inside this crazy ride,
Trying to keep my budget tight.

(Chorus)
What is inflation? Can someone tell me?
Is it magic or just some mystery?
Why do things cost more and more each day?
I’m lost in numbers, what’s the way?
Oh, what is inflation? I can’t understand,
It’s slipping through my fingers like grains of sand.

(Outro)
Maybe someday I’ll get it right,
Till then I’ll hold my wallet tight.
