ðŸŽµ "Somehow Still One"
(Alternative Rock)

[Verse 1]
Woke up in the same old land,
Lines drawn deep in shifting sand.
Your flag donâ€™t look like mine,
Your truth lives on the other side of the sign.

You speak in fire, I breathe in ice,
You pray for peace, I roll the dice.
We build our walls inside our heads,
But share the street, the sky, the bread.

[Pre-Chorus]
Didnâ€™t think weâ€™d make it this farâ€”
Two hearts beating in a splintered car.

[Chorus]
Weâ€™ve got nothing in common but the ground beneath our feet,
Weâ€™re shouting in languages weâ€™ll never speak.
The lines divide, the noise gets loud,
But weâ€™re still standing under the same cloud.
Surprised as hell, but we wonâ€™t runâ€”
Yeah, weâ€™re torn apart, but somehow still one.

[Verse 2]
You see a hero where I see harm,
You raise your hand, I raise alarms.
But we still shop at the same damn store,
Still hold the door, still fight this war.

Weâ€™ve got names we wonâ€™t repeat,
But walk the same cracked concrete.
Your world ends where mine beginsâ€”
Yet here we are, not giving in.

[Pre-Chorus]
Itâ€™s not love, maybe not even graceâ€”
Just stubborn roots we canâ€™t erase.

[Chorus]
Weâ€™ve got nothing in common but the sky overhead,
Still sing different songs with the same regret.
The borders grow inside our bones,
But we both call this place home.
It makes no sense, but we wonâ€™t runâ€”
Weâ€™re bruised and breaking, but somehow still one.

[Bridge â€“ Soft to Loud Build]
Different gods, different truths,
Different dreams under one roof.
But we bleed the same when weâ€™re cutâ€”
Thatâ€™s enoughâ€¦
Thatâ€™s enough.

[Final Chorus â€“ Explosive]
Weâ€™ve got nothing in common but the name we share,
Both lost in a country that forgot how to care.
Still here, still trying not to drown,
Still fighting for the same battleground.
Donâ€™t know why, but we wonâ€™t runâ€”
Yeah, weâ€™re hanging onâ€¦
Somehow still one.

[Outro â€“ Quiet, fading]
Somehowâ€¦
Still one.
