✝️⚙️ "Third Day Protocol"

(Progressive/Industrial Metal – Anthemic, heavy, cinematic)
Christian resurrection themes meet futuristic biotech resurrection
[Verse 1 – Slow build, clean vocals + heavy drums]

They sealed the tomb, cold steel and light
A thousand prayers cast into night
The world stood still. No breath. No flame.
Just silence carved beneath His name

The crowd had wept, the healers fled
But wires wrapped around the dead
And in the dark, a pulse returned—
A second birth. A system burned.
[Pre-Chorus – Choir-style clean vocals over chugging guitar]

🎵
They said: “He died for us”
Now they say: “We brought Him back.”
Miracles through silicon—
No heaven, just the mainframe's track.
🎵
[Chorus – Soaring and heavy, with gang vocals]

🎶
On the third day… He rose again
With copper veins and glowing skin
The sick now walk, the blind now see—
By grace of gears and circuitry

Crowds cry out with lifted hands
The dead now rise by human plans
It’s not the sky that heals the land…
But code… and steel… at our command.
🎶
[Verse 2 – Heavier, more intense]

They printed flesh, they stoked the spark
With data fed into the dark
A voice returned that once had died
Not holy ghost, but hard drive tied

The lame were patched, the deaf were tuned
A thousand wounds rebuilt by noon
It smelled like faith, but tasted strange
Like rusted nails… and DNA chains
[Bridge – Slow breakdown, ominous and majestic]

(growled):
**“Is this salvation… or control?”
“Is it grace… or just a goal?”
**“Can you be saved… without a soul?”
“Is this the Christ… or protocol?”
[Final Chorus – Larger, with choir backing]

🎶
On the third day… He walked again
Not born of God… but crafted men
The crowd still cheered, the lepers healed—
Though Heaven's gate remained sealed

No burning bush, no thunder heard—
Just surgeons dressed as shepherds' word
And in their labs, beneath the lights
They gave the world… a second Christ
🎶
[Outro – Clean guitar and fading synths]

(spoken softly)
"And lo... He returned.
Not from heaven above.
But from hands of flesh and wire below."
