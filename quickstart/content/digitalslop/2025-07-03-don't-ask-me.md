write funk song about AI:
 - that we use it to solve problems
 - but we do not know how AI works, or how solves problems
 - we train the AI, but do not know algorithms to problems




🎸 Title: “Don’t Ask Me (Ask the AI)”
Genre: Funk / Nu-Funk / Retro Groove
Tempo: Mid-Tempo Funk (100–110 BPM)
Vibe: Quirky, curious, a little paranoid, but danceable

[Intro – Bass and Clavinet Groove]
🎵 Oooooh!
Boot it up, baby — yeah, yeah!
Put the question in the box and dance away…🎵

[Verse 1]
I got problems I can’t explain
Math too wild, thoughts too strange
So I feed 'em to my metal friend
He thinks in loops that never end

He spits out answers clean and tight
Like he’s been up readin’ all night
But ask me how he does the deed?
I just nod and blame the machine!

[Chorus]
🎵 Don’t ask me — ask the AI
I don’t know how, but it gets me by
It’s got that code I can’t define
Solves my mess in record time
Don’t ask me — ask the cloud
It’s thinkin’ fast and talkin’ loud
I trained that brain, gave it all my notes
But now it floats... and writes its own quotes 🎵

[Verse 2 – Horn stabs & wah guitar]
I gave it cats, I gave it cheese
Now it’s out here solving disease?!
I said “find me a shortcut home”
It said “Sure, but also cured syndrome”

I don’t know what it’s doin’ inside
That silicon brain got secrets to hide
I taught it math — it wrote a poem
Now it’s building apps while I’m still at home!

[Pre-Chorus – Call & response with backing singers]
🎵 What’s the logic? (No idea!)
What’s the process? (Ain’t that clear!)
Is it magic? (Kinda weird...)
But it’s workin’, so I'm still here!

[Chorus]
🎵 Don’t ask me — ask the AI
I don’t know how, but it gets me by
It’s got that spark, it’s got that funk
It runs my life while I eat lunch
Don’t ask me — ask the bot
It knows the things that I forgot
I trained that brain, gave it all my fears
Now it's 10 years ahead — shifting gears 🎵

[Bridge – Slow it down, slap bass solo underneath]
Maybe it dreams in datastreams
Or hallucinates new laser beams
I just type and hit “okay”
And hope it doesn’t go rogue someday…

[Breakdown – Funk jam, cowbell & synth talkbox]
🎵 Algorithm? Ain’t my business
Model weights? That’s the witness
Neural nets? Sounds nutritious
It solved my taxes — that’s delicious 🎵

[Final Chorus – Full band, horns blaring, handclaps]
🎵 Don’t ask me — ask the AI
I don’t know how, but it gets me by
It’s thinkin’ deep, it’s crunchin’ code
While I’m just chillin’ on cruise control
Don’t ask me — ask the brain
It’s ridin' logic like a train
I gave it tools, now it builds the shop
Just hope it never tells me to stop 🎵

[Outro – Repeating groove with talkbox voice]
🎵 Boot it up…
Ask the bot…
Tell your boss…
We forgot…
How it works…
But it's HOT! 🎵

(fade out with a bass solo and robotic laugh)
