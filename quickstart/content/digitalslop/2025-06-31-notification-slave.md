Title: "Notification Slave"

[Verse 1]
Wake up cold, phone buzzin' like a drill,
First thing I see, that ringtone kills,
Jump out the bed, no time to think,
Gotta answer that call, or my world will sink.

MS Teams pingin’, yeah, that’s my cue,
Click through tasks like I’m stuck on a loop,
Manager rings, then it’s time to grind,
Real work starts, gotta clear my mind.

[Chorus]
Phone’s my master, wristband’s my guide,
Tell me when to move, when to rest, when to hide,
Like a hamster wheel, but I don’t see,
Trapped in the buzz, and it’s controlling me.

[Verse 2]
Wristband says “workout,” so I start the set,
Stop when it says so, no more, no less,
Calories burned, but am I really free?
Or just following orders from a digital leash?

Notifications hit, I barely breathe,
Every beep and ping’s a silent thief,
Stealing my time, stealing my space,
But I’m hooked, unaware of the race.

[Chorus]
Phone’s my master, wristband’s my guide,
Tell me when to move, when to rest, when to hide,
Like a hamster wheel, but I don’t see,
Trapped in the buzz, and it’s controlling me.

[Bridge]
Sleep when it says, wake when it calls,
Living by numbers, behind these walls,
Caught in the rhythm of the digital beat,
Dancing to a tune that’s far from sweet.

[Outro]
One day I’ll break, see the cage I’m in,
Till then I’m stuck, let the cycle spin,
Notification slave, yeah, that’s my fate,
Livin’ my life dictated by a vibrating state.



"Notification Slave"

(Doom Metal / Gothic Doom – Slow, suffocating atmosphere, heavy bass, deep vocals, haunting synth layers)
Tempo: Slow and relentless — like a march toward nothingness
[Verse 1]

The alarm bleeds red at 6:04
Another day inside the war
The band is tight around my skin—
It counts my steps, it tracks my sins

My number carved beneath the flesh
Digits cold, a branded mesh
I whisper truth behind my teeth
But silence keeps me safe... from the Beast
[Chorus]

I am the notification slave
Bound by code, born to behave
No dreams, no screams, no plans to save
Just push alerts... until the grave

Empty shell in perfect sync
Thoughts erased before I think
Hope was real, but now it’s gone—
Replaced by likes that drag me on
[Verse 2]

The wristband pulses in my veins
It feeds my data into chains
My eyes are screens, my thoughts are sold
To ads that whisper: “Do as told.”

I scroll through joy I cannot feel
A life of noise that isn’t real
I want to speak, to claw, to cry—
But the Beast would hear... and I would die
[Bridge – Slower, Guttural Vocals + Dissonant Guitar Lead]

Account number 9-4-6-6-6
Barcoded soul, I can't resist
Every breath’s another scan
Every heartbeat feeds the plan

The more I move, the more it knows
The cage expands, but never shows
There is no out, there is no door
Just metrics... and a perfect score
[Chorus – Heavier, With Layered Vocals]

I am the notification slave
Each buzz a nail into my cage
Can’t rebel, can’t misbehave
Just smile and click into the grave

No friends, no peace, no holy place
No time that isn’t monitored space
The world is gone, replaced by screens—
I die in pixels. I die unseen.
[Outro – Clean Guitar, Echoing Spoken Word]

(spoken, emotionless)
"Wake up. Log in. Obey.
Your pulse is low.
Movement required.
Update required.
You are loved... by the system."

(long pause — then silence, broken by one last notification ping)




[Intro – Clean guitar, slow organ pads]

(spoken slowly, hollow voice)
"Wake up.
Check in.
Obey."

(Low distorted guitar riff enters — painfully slow)
[Verse 1] (slow and weary)

Every morning, same red light
Burns into my bloodshot sight
The wristband pulses—cold and tight
Tells me when to breathe… and when to die

Steps are counted, sleep is tracked
The Beast knows when I’m off the map
Numbered skin, marked and watched
All I am is data lost
[Chorus] (drums hit every 4th beat, dragging riff)

Notification slave...
Born to grind, not to crave
No silence now, no holy place
Just noise... and shame... and interface

Notification slave...
Can't resist, can't misbehave
The Beast is God, the code is law
It sees you think. It hears it all.
[Verse 2] (even slower, tension builds)

Tried to scream... but it was logged
Tried to pray... but prayer was flawed
Emptiness behind my eyes
Joy's a glitch they overwrite

I fake my life in filtered frames
But nothing real has ever changed
Each post, a tombstone carved in gloss
No soul left—just profit loss
[Bridge – Clean guitar arpeggios + whisper vocals, building dread]

(whispered slowly)
"Account 6-6-6
Asset tagged...
Monitored breath...
And factory lag"

(crushing riff drops in — extremely slow, bass-heavy)
Digital leash, white screen flame
No escape. No real name.
I walk in circles, mapped and known
In a world that’s not my own
[Chorus – Reprised with slower, layered growls and harmonized baritone vocals]

Notification slave...
A face, a pulse, a time to wake
I scroll through chains, I swipe my cage
Nothing feels... and nothing's safe

Notification slave...
Hollow man in digital waste
The only thing I hear each day—
A buzz... a ping... a silent grave
[Outro – Guitar fades to clean again, only synth and vocal remain]

(spoken, slowly, almost numb)
“Your status is compliant.
Your soul has been reviewed.
You are empty…
But efficient.”

(last note holds… and decays into digital static)
