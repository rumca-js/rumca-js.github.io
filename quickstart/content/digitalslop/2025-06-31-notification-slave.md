Title: "Notification Slave"

[Verse 1]
Wake up cold, phone buzzin' like a drill,
First thing I see, that ringtone kills,
Jump out the bed, no time to think,
Gotta answer that call, or my world will sink.

MS Teams pingin’, yeah, that’s my cue,
Click through tasks like I’m stuck on a loop,
Manager rings, then it’s time to grind,
Real work starts, gotta clear my mind.

[Chorus]
Phone’s my master, wristband’s my guide,
Tell me when to move, when to rest, when to hide,
Like a hamster wheel, but I don’t see,
Trapped in the buzz, and it’s controlling me.

[Verse 2]
Wristband says “workout,” so I start the set,
Stop when it says so, no more, no less,
Calories burned, but am I really free?
Or just following orders from a digital leash?

Notifications hit, I barely breathe,
Every beep and ping’s a silent thief,
Stealing my time, stealing my space,
But I’m hooked, unaware of the race.

[Chorus]
Phone’s my master, wristband’s my guide,
Tell me when to move, when to rest, when to hide,
Like a hamster wheel, but I don’t see,
Trapped in the buzz, and it’s controlling me.

[Bridge]
Sleep when it says, wake when it calls,
Living by numbers, behind these walls,
Caught in the rhythm of the digital beat,
Dancing to a tune that’s far from sweet.

[Outro]
One day I’ll break, see the cage I’m in,
Till then I’m stuck, let the cycle spin,
Notification slave, yeah, that’s my fate,
Livin’ my life dictated by a vibrating state.
