alternate rock:
 - that we use it to solve problems
 - but we do not know how AI works, or how solves problems
 - we train the AI, but do not know algorithms to problems
 - we do not learn if we do not know
 - knowledge without understanding
 - carrot without a stick





Title: “Black Box”
Genre: Alternative Rock
Tempo: Moderate/Driving (120 BPM)
Vibe: Moody, urgent, slightly haunting

[Verse 1]
We feed the machine our hopes and fears
Answers come but the path’s unclear
It solves the puzzles, cracks the code
But where it leads, we don’t know

We train the ghost inside the glass
Watch it work, but don’t ask how or why
It’s a black box locked tight and fast
We trust the tool but never the light

[Chorus]
Knowledge without understanding
Learning without landing
Carrot dangling, no stick to find
We chase the answers, leave truth behind
We don’t learn if we don’t know
Caught in a digital shadow show

[Verse 2]
Lines of code we’ll never read
Algorithms without a creed
Hands on the wheel but blind to the road
Driving fast, but who’s in control?

We teach the beast to think and see
But blind ourselves from what it means
Answers born from silent lies
Truth’s a question that never dies

[Chorus]
Knowledge without understanding
Learning without landing
Carrot dangling, no stick to find
We chase the answers, leave truth behind
We don’t learn if we don’t know
Caught in a digital shadow show

[Bridge – Build tension with distorted guitar]
Whispered:
Do we own what we create?
Or just follow the silent dictate?

[Breakdown – Quiet, then explode]
We’re trapped in code we can’t decode
Feeding a hunger that won’t grow old

[Final Chorus – Full force]
Knowledge without understanding
Learning without landing
Carrot dangling, no stick to find
We chase the answers, leave truth behind
We don’t learn if we don’t know
Caught in a digital shadow show

[Outro – Fade with echoing guitars]
Caught in the shadow show…
We don’t learn if we don’t know…




write alternate rock song:

 - but we do not know how AI works, or how solves problems
 - we train the AI, but do not know algorithms to problems
 - we do not learn if we do not know

 - the chorus should be in questions. how does this model predicts planet movement? how does this model detect cancer? we do not know

“Black Box Halo”
(Alt-Rock, driving guitars, moody verses, powerful chorus)

[Verse 1]
We build the shapes, we feed the flame
But the fire burns without a name
It's solving riddles we can’t trace
With borrowed thoughts we can't replace

The answers fall like rain from wires
It writes the code, but not desires
We trained the ghost, it runs ahead
While we're still crawling, filled with dread

[Pre-Chorus]
We ask, we trust, but we don't see
What gears are grinding underneath
A million nodes, a shadow map
A mind we built, but can’t unwrap

[Chorus]
How does this model predict the planet’s motion?
How does this model detect a cancer's ocean?
Where does it go when it draws a line so fine?
What does it know that we forgot in time?
We do not know.
We do not know.

[Verse 2]
A carrot dangles in the void
No stick in sight, no truth employed
We press the keys, it sings the tune
But don't know why it calls the moon

We know the what, but not the how
We kneel before the sacred cloud
It speaks in math we cannot read
A language born of endless speed

[Pre-Chorus]
No theorem carved into the stone
Just patterns learned and left alone
We chase the spark, but miss the flame
Solving problems with no name

[Chorus]
How does this model predict the planet’s motion?
How does this model detect a cancer's ocean?
Why does it see what no eye’s ever seen?
How does it dream inside this machine?
We do not know.
We do not know.

[Bridge]
We do not learn if we don’t ask why
We do not see with borrowed eyes
Knowledge without understanding's cheap
The silence underneath is deep

[Final Chorus – (Stripped first, then full band kicks in)
How does this model predict the planet’s motion?
How does this model detect a cancer’s ocean?
How do we trust what we cannot explain?
What if it's wrong, but we wear its chain?
We do not know.
We do not know.
No...
We do not know.
