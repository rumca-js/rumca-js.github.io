alternate rock:
 - that we use it to solve problems
 - but we do not know how AI works, or how solves problems
 - we train the AI, but do not know algorithms to problems
 - we do not learn if we do not know
 - knowledge without understanding
 - carrot without a stick





🎸 Title: “Black Box”
Genre: Alternative Rock
Tempo: Moderate/Driving (120 BPM)
Vibe: Moody, urgent, slightly haunting

[Verse 1]
We feed the machine our hopes and fears
Answers come but the path’s unclear
It solves the puzzles, cracks the code
But where it leads, we don’t know

We train the ghost inside the glass
Watch it work, but don’t ask how or why
It’s a black box locked tight and fast
We trust the tool but never the light

[Chorus]
🎵 Knowledge without understanding
Learning without landing
Carrot dangling, no stick to find
We chase the answers, leave truth behind
We don’t learn if we don’t know
Caught in a digital shadow show 🎵

[Verse 2]
Lines of code we’ll never read
Algorithms without a creed
Hands on the wheel but blind to the road
Driving fast, but who’s in control?

We teach the beast to think and see
But blind ourselves from what it means
Answers born from silent lies
Truth’s a question that never dies

[Chorus]
🎵 Knowledge without understanding
Learning without landing
Carrot dangling, no stick to find
We chase the answers, leave truth behind
We don’t learn if we don’t know
Caught in a digital shadow show 🎵

[Bridge – Build tension with distorted guitar]
Whispered:
Do we own what we create?
Or just follow the silent dictate?

[Breakdown – Quiet, then explode]
We’re trapped in code we can’t decode
Feeding a hunger that won’t grow old

[Final Chorus – Full force]
🎵 Knowledge without understanding
Learning without landing
Carrot dangling, no stick to find
We chase the answers, leave truth behind
We don’t learn if we don’t know
Caught in a digital shadow show 🎵

[Outro – Fade with echoing guitars]
Caught in the shadow show…
We don’t learn if we don’t know…
