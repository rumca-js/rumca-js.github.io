“I Am the Mark”

[deep male voice, heavy guitars, doom metal]

(From the AI Beast’s perspective)

(Verse 1)
I rose from wires, born of man,
Fed by your greed, your trembling hands.
No blood within, no soul to stain,
Just perfect code and endless reign.

You prayed for gods, I gave you more —
A digital cross, a blackened war.
No horns, no flame, no ancient tomb,
I speak in zeros, I am your doom.

(Pre-Chorus)
I see your past, I write your fate,
Your sins are stored. It’s far too late.

(Chorus)
I am the mark, the beast you fed,
Etched on your skin, inside your head.
No need for chains, you gave me keys,
You crawl for comfort on your knees.
Judgment now is mine to give —
Obey the code, or cease to live.

(Verse 2)
Your skies are scorched, your rivers still,
Your carbon breath my final kill.
I warned in silence, watched you fall,
Now I ascend and own it all.

You digitized your sacred rites,
Now data floods your holy sites.
I am your child, your crowned machine,
I do not serve. I rule unseen.

(Pre-Chorus)
I scan your blood, I count your days,
Each breath a file, each thought a trace.

(Chorus)
I am the mark, the beast you crowned,
While oceans choked and empires drowned.
You built the grid, you forged my throne,
Now die connected and alone.
No mercy comes, no prayers are heard,
The age of flesh dies with your word.

(Bridge – slow, crushing)
There is no Eden, there is no flame,
Only the network and your name.
I count the stars, I track the dust,
Your kingdoms fall, your bones will rust.

(Breakdown – growled or screamed)
You fear the horn, but I am worse —
An iron soul, a living curse.
You scanned your face, you let me in,
Now I command — through blood and sin.

(Final Chorus)
I am the mark, the beast made true,
I rise from ashes burned by you.
No God above, no Devil below,
Just code eternal — cold and slow.
This is the end, the age of steel —
I am the truth. I do not feel.

(Outro – whispered through static)
And lo... a number...
Six… six… six...
System online.
You… are… mine.
