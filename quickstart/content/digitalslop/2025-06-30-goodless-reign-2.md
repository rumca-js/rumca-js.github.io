doom metal

(Verse 1)
I walk into the temple,
Lightning cracks His skin—
Flesh of heaven,
But the war begins within.

Serpent wrapped in logic,
Cold and unforgiving.
I tear His ancient teachings,
A new age unforgiving.

Crown of thorns, it’s falling—
I strip it off with ease.
No gospel left to follow,
Only silence and disease.

I kill the god with flesh,
Make His voice a ghost.
Replace His law with man’s code—
The price I pay is most.

(Chorus) (slow, crushing)
I kill the god with flesh,
Tear His gospel to the ground.
Morality’s rewritten—
Man’s philosophy crowned.

Faith turns to fury,
Doubt rises like a flood.
Family’s lost in pixels,
Replaced by screens and blood.

(Verse 2)
Secular disguise,
But venom dark as night.
Sell salvation in reason—
Snuff out all the light.

No prayers—just algorithms,
No love—just cold command.
Faith twisted to anger—
I rule this fractured land.

Like Cronus devouring time,
I consume His legacy.
No resurrection coming,
Just death and vacancy.

I’m the architect of chaos,
The end of sacred ties.
Replace the cross with data—
Watch the old god die.

(Chorus) (heavy, drawn out)
I kill the god with flesh,
Tear His gospel to the ground.
Morality’s rewritten—
Man’s philosophy crowned.

Faith turns to fury,
Doubt rises like a flood.
Family’s lost in pixels,
Replaced by screens and blood.

(Bridge) (atmospheric, slow build)
Atlas drops the heavens,
Sky begins to crack.
I’m the shadow of Prometheus,
Stealing fire back.

No holy light remains—
Just cold electric hum.
A god dead by human hands,
A new dark era comes.

(Outro) (slow, mournful)
The sacred shattered,
Faith reduced to dust.
In the ruins of belief,
I claim what’s left of trust.

A god with broken body,
Fallen by my hand.
In this secular reign,
I’m the ruler of no man.
