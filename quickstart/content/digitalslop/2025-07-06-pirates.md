write folk metal song:
 - about merry band of digital pirates
 - they are free, obey no law
 - they shoot malware from cannons
 - they use web ships
 - they cannot be stopped
 - they have pirate bay forever in their hearts



ðŸŽµ Sails of the Cyber Sea ðŸŽµ
Folk Metal Anthem of the Digital Corsairs

[Verse 1]
Out on the waves of the old darknet
Where the firewalls burn and the code is wet
We sail with our laughter, our rum, and our pride
With no flag to serve and no truth to hide

We ride on ships made of tangled code
Through thunderous clouds where no laws go
The silicon storms, they tremble with fright
When they see our sails in the neon light

[Chorus]
Raise your glass, you wild and free!
To the lords of the cyber sea!
We fire our malware from iron jaws
We answer to no man, no kings, no laws!
With Pirate Bay burned in our hearts
From the net, weâ€™ll never part
We are the code, the key, the flameâ€”
No one shall tame our digital name!

[Verse 2]
They built up walls, they built up gates
They tried to bind us with their fates
But our anchors are truth, our compass the storm
Weâ€™re born from the breach where legends are born

BitTorrent winds fill our glowing sails
As we ghost through their data trails
The trackers may chase, the hunters may try
But we vanish like whispers into the sky

[Bridge â€“ Instrumental with hurdy-gurdy and heavy guitar riff]
(Sounds of cannon blasts, dial-up noises, modem screeches layered with war drums)

[Verse 3]
We plunder the vaults of the digital keep
While giants above us tremble in sleep
We dance with worms, we drink with hacks
We leave no trace, and we donâ€™t look back

[Chorus â€“ repeat with gang vocals]
Raise your glass, you wild and free!
To the lords of the cyber sea!
We fire our malware from iron jaws
We answer to no man, no kings, no laws!
With Pirate Bay burned in our hearts
From the net, weâ€™ll never part
We are the code, the key, the flameâ€”
No one shall tame our digital name!

[Outro â€“ soft folk melody fading to distortion]
So light the torch and crack the key
We're bound forever to the sea
Our souls encrypted, our banners highâ€”
Digital pirates shall never die.
