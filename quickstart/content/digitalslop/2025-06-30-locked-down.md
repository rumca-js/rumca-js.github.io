write a hip-hop song about more control over internet
 - verses should be written from a perspective of a person who wants more control, so it should be "I"
 - she wants login requirement everywhere
 - two factor authentication, to protect from bad actors
 - she wants ID to be shown to platforms, to verify age
 - paywalls to pay the sites
 - at the end she lost authentication key, forgot recovery password
 at received mail that she commited a fraud of giving incorrect age to site
 - in the song there should be clear chorus statements like "require passwords", "require IDs"



“Too Locked Down”

[male voice hip-hop rap]

[Verse 1]
I’m callin’ out for order, need more moderation,
Pages locked behind the login, no more free navigation.
Passwords strong, can’t let just anyone roam,
I want control, keep this internet a safe home.

[Chorus]
Login first, show me who you are,
Keep the chaos locked out, raise the bar.
Step by step, more walls rise high,
But am I still welcome, or just passin’ by?

[Verse 2]
Now age verification’s rollin’ in tight,
No kids slipping through in the dead of the night.
Protect the young, keep the content clean,
No shady business, no lurking unseen.

Two-factor kicks in, double-check my claim,
Send the code, prove I’m not playin’ a game.
Every layer added, feels like a test,
Is this what it takes to keep out the rest?

[Chorus]
Login first, show me who you are,
Keep the chaos locked out, raise the bar.
Step by step, more walls rise high,
But am I still welcome, or just passin’ by?

[Verse 3]
Now kids’ protections guard the door,
Filtering content they shouldn’t explore.
Parental controls, locked and tight,
Make sure the shadows don’t steal the light.

Captcha puzzles, and email verifications,
Security grows like endless iterations.
I’m watching it all, demanding the best,
But my own keys get lost in the test.

[Bridge]
Click, click — more walls around me grow,
Click, click — passwords I can’t even know.
I built this fortress to keep out the wild,
But the gates slam shut — am I still a child?

[Final Chorus]
Login first, show me who you are,
Keep the chaos locked out, raise the bar.
Step by step, more walls rise high,
But as the door closes — I’m left outside.

[Outro]
I wanted safety, control, and peace,
But all these locks locked me out of the lease.
Moderation’s price, a bitter key,
I’m barred from the site I wanted to see.





Title: "Control Protocol"
Hip-Hop song moody female vocal

[Verse 1]
I want a world where you can't just roam
Gotta log in, prove it before you call it home
No more ghosts in the comment threads
Put your name on the line or don’t get fed

Age check, birthdate, scan that card
I seen too many kids tryna act too hard
If you wanna post, then pay that toll
You want the truth? Then earn control

No free rides, no hidden face
If you show up here, you leave a trace
Fake accounts, I shut ‘em down
I built this net to wear a crown

[Chorus]
Require passwords, lock the gate
Require IDs, don’t let it skate
Two-step auth, no slipping through
Pay to play, that’s what we do

Require passwords, lock it down
Require IDs, scan this town
Keep it clean, no shade allowed
But now I’m locked out, head in the cloud

[Verse 2]
2FA, I'm preachin’ daily
No click without that backup, baby
Link your phone, or lose the pass
No access code? You ain't gettin’ past

I built the wall to keep out threats
Made it tighter than the internet gets
Sentinels posted, data secure
Everything filtered, everything pure

But one bad night, I slipped, forgot
Auth key gone, and my system locked
Tried recovery—what’s the email? Wrong
Clicked “forgot,” but it’s been too long

[Chorus]
Require passwords, lock the gate
Require IDs, don’t let it skate
Two-step auth, no slipping through
Pay to play, that’s what we do

Require passwords, lock it down
Require IDs, scan this town
Keep it clean, no shade allowed
But now I’m locked out, head in the cloud

[Verse 3]
Then came the mail, cold and bold
“You lied on your age,” is what I was told
Said I checked that box just to get inside
Now they flagged my name like I had to hide

Fraud, they wrote — violation code
The same hard laws that I once imposed
Turned back ‘round, aimed at me
My empire crashed from security

I wanted order, now I face the cost
I made a fortress... then I got lost
Built the maze, forgot the map
Now I sit outside the trap

[Chorus - Final]
Require passwords, that was me
Require IDs, thought it’d set us free
Two-step auth, ‘cause trust don’t grow
Pay to play — now I can't go

Require passwords, I said it loud
Require IDs, standin' proud
Built a world to stop the fraud
But now I pray to get past God
