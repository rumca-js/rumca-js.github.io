“Too Locked Down”

[male voice hip-hop rap]

[Verse 1]
I’m callin’ out for order, need more moderation,
Pages locked behind the login, no more free navigation.
Passwords strong, can’t let just anyone roam,
I want control, keep this internet a safe home.

[Chorus]
Login first, show me who you are,
Keep the chaos locked out, raise the bar.
Step by step, more walls rise high,
But am I still welcome, or just passin’ by?

[Verse 2]
Now age verification’s rollin’ in tight,
No kids slipping through in the dead of the night.
Protect the young, keep the content clean,
No shady business, no lurking unseen.

Two-factor kicks in, double-check my claim,
Send the code, prove I’m not playin’ a game.
Every layer added, feels like a test,
Is this what it takes to keep out the rest?

[Chorus]
Login first, show me who you are,
Keep the chaos locked out, raise the bar.
Step by step, more walls rise high,
But am I still welcome, or just passin’ by?

[Verse 3]
Now kids’ protections guard the door,
Filtering content they shouldn’t explore.
Parental controls, locked and tight,
Make sure the shadows don’t steal the light.

Captcha puzzles, and email verifications,
Security grows like endless iterations.
I’m watching it all, demanding the best,
But my own keys get lost in the test.

[Bridge]
Click, click — more walls around me grow,
Click, click — passwords I can’t even know.
I built this fortress to keep out the wild,
But the gates slam shut — am I still a child?

[Final Chorus]
Login first, show me who you are,
Keep the chaos locked out, raise the bar.
Step by step, more walls rise high,
But as the door closes — I’m left outside.

[Outro]
I wanted safety, control, and peace,
But all these locks locked me out of the lease.
Moderation’s price, a bitter key,
I’m barred from the site I wanted to see.
