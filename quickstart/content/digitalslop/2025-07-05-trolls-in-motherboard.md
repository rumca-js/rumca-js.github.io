write funny folk metal song about trolls living inside of computer


🎻💻 "Trolls in the Motherboard"

(Folk Metal / Humppa Metal – Upbeat, chaotic, mischievous tone)
Accordion, distorted guitars, fiddle, double kick drums, group chants and goofy vocals)
[Intro – Accordion + Jig Fiddle]

(sung in deep, over-the-top troll voice)
🎶 I opened up my laptop just to check my mail…
But the screen went green and the fans did wail!
The mouse ran off, the keyboard roared—
There’s TROLLS in the bloody motherboard! 🎶
[Verse 1]

They drink my RAM like it’s trollish wine
They chew on cables, they steal my time
They changed my screensaver to goats in a war
Now nothing works like it did before!

They clog my ports with pixel dust
They changed my files to elvish smut
They downloaded memes from 2004
Then summoned a worm through a USB drawer!
[Chorus – Fast and rowdy, with group vocals]

🎶 TROLLS! TROLLS! In the circuitry cave!
Fartin’ in fans like the olden knave!
They dance on chips, they mock my cries—
They screenshot shame and eat my drives! 🎶

🎶 Trolls! Trolls! In the processing pit!
They hacked my fridge and made it spit!
My Google doc turned into a sword—
I’m cursed by TROLLS in the motherboard! 🎶
[Verse 2]

They photoshopped my family tree
To show that grandma's half-USB
They made my speaker scream at night
And replaced my texts with “Trolls have rights!”

They livestreamed me in underpants
Then edited it with folk dance chants
They changed my bank PIN to “BUTT69”
And bought 12 goats on Amazon Prime!
[Bridge – Folk instrumental solo: fiddle + accordion dueling, jig tempo]
[Chorus – Reprise with extra troll growls and flute harmony]

🎶 Trolls! Trolls! In the HDMI!
They sent my emails to the sky!
They twerked on Zoom, they cursed my cord—
Those pixel beasts I can’t afford! 🎶

🎶 Trolls! Trolls! In the SSD!
They photoshopped my dog as me!
They bite the fans, they bark and hoard—
They RULE this house from the motherboard! 🎶
[Outro – Slow, drunken singalong with hurdy-gurdy and tankards clanking]

🎶 So if your screen goes black one day...
And your Netflix plays a troll ballet...
Don’t panic, friend, just slam some mead—
And sacrifice a mouse... for peace. 🎶

(group troll chant)
"TROLLS! TROLLS! TROLLS!"
