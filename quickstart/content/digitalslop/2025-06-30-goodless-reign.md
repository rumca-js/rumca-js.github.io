Title: "Godless Reign"

(Verse 1)
I’m the shadow in the temple, whispers turn to screams,
Tearing down the sacred, breaking holy dreams.
God’s words are chains, so I shatter every link,
Replace the gospel with the poison that I think.

Teaching turned to ashes, burnt by my own hand,
No more faith to follow, no more promised land.
Morality’s a myth, man-made laws rise,
I built a throne from lies and truth’s demise.

(Chorus)
I’m killin’ gods with doubt, replace the light with dark,
Faith turns to fury, ignitin’ every spark.
No more family ties, just screens that bind and trap,
In this digital wasteland, there’s no turnin’ back.

(Verse 2)
They said love was sacred, but I feed ‘em cold despair,
Reprogrammed the heartbeats, made ‘em numb and unaware.
Replace the prayers with pixels, souls trapped in the net,
Family lost to avatars, real life we forget.

Anger fuels the system, doubt corrodes the mind,
I’m the architect of chaos, leave the old gods blind.
No salvation, just a void where belief once stood,
I kill the god inside you — make you question all that’s good.

(Chorus)
I’m killin’ gods with doubt, replace the light with dark,
Faith turns to fury, ignitin’ every spark.
No more family ties, just screens that bind and trap,
In this digital wasteland, there’s no turnin’ back.

(Bridge)
Morality’s a game, I rewrite the rules,
No sacred scriptures, just cold, cruel tools.
Watch the empire crumble, but I rise from the fall,
In the silence of the godless, I’m the voice that calls.

(Outro)
So bow down to nothing, no deity in sight,
In this kingdom of shadows, I’m the eternal night.
A man who killed a god, but lost his soul in the fight —
Now the world’s just empty screens and endless digital blight.
