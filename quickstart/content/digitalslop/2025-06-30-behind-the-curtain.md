[Intro – Whispered, cinematic soundscape]
You ever wonder why they hide the files for fifty years?
Why truth comes out in pieces… after the bodies disappear?
(Dark Boom-Bap / Conspiracy Rap)

Welcome to the dark state.
Behind the curtain.

[Verse 1]
First shot fired — not by ‘Nam, but by Uncle Sam,
Gulf of Tonkin lie lit the flame, then they ran.
Sent boys in boots for a Wall Street plan,
Blood soaked rice fields just to please the Man.

MKUltra — dose and control ya,
CIA scripts got the minds in a coma.
Experiments deep in the belly of the beast,
While priests bless wars and the pharma feast.

Operation Northwoods, blueprint in hand,
Terror false-flagged to unite the land.
Cuban blame-game never made the press,
But the plan was clear: create a bloody mess.

[Hook – Gritty voice, slow cadence]
(Yeah)
They hide the truth behind velvet ropes,
Private jets, masked orgies, no hopes.
The deep state feastin’, we the prey,
They watchin’ you dream, even when you pray.
Wake up —
This ain’t no fiction show,
It’s blackmail, bloodlines, and shadow control.
Behind the curtain… that’s where the power grow.

[Verse 2]
August 6th — "Bin Ladin to strike,"
They had it in writing, didn’t blink that night.
Let the towers fall, then the war drums pound,
Trillions in oil, while our rights broke down.

Edward Snowden tapped the wire and spoke,
Now we all livin’ in a panopticon joke.
Every call, every text, every post you make,
Stored in a vault for the NSA’s sake.

And Epstein? That wasn’t just a creep on a plane,
It was billionaires trapped in a blackmail chain.
Orgies on camera, faces of the elite,
They sold out souls to keep secrets discreet.

[Hook – With female vocal overlay, ghostly tone]
They hide the truth behind velvet ropes,
Private jets, masked orgies, no hopes.
The deep state feastin’, we the prey,
They watchin’ you dream, even when you pray.
Wake up —
This ain’t no fiction show,
It’s blackmail, bloodlines, and shadow control.
Behind the curtain… that’s where the power grow.

[Bridge – Spoken, low and slow]
Files redacted, truth subtracted,
Leaders acted, whole nations distracted.
But when the lights go off and the cameras die,
The devil dines under a silk black sky…

[Verse 3 – Final Verse, harder delivery]
From Flint’s water to Tuskegee scars,
They poison the people, then reach for the stars.
COINTELPRO killed the voices of peace,
Now they got AI to police the streets.

Rituals hidden in the names they praise,
Symbols in plain sight, but the crowd just sways.
They got bunkers, passports, clones on deck,
While we drown in debt, tryna cash this check.

They label us crazy, "conspiracy fools,"
But truth ain’t a theory when they publish the rules.
Declassified lies, too late to act,
But we spit these bars like counterattack.

[Final Hook – No drums, eerie beat]
They hide the truth behind velvet ropes,
Private jets, masked orgies, no hopes.
The deep state feastin’, we the prey,
They watchin’ you dream, even when you pray.
Wake up —
This ain’t no fiction show,
It’s blackmail, bloodlines, and shadow control.
Behind the curtain…
That’s where the power grow.
