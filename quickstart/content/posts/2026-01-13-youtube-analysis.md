 - many of channels that are most subscribed to are a waste of time. They are targetted to kids, low quality, or click baity (like nastya, alan's universe, toys and colors, luccas toon)

 - many of channels are targeted to kids, which makes me depressed. That is how kids are being raisied today

 - channels from india have viewership and subscribe counts that often dwarfs 'western' videos. I know that there are many people in india, but maaaaan....

 - there are many channels that I would expect there to be. There are channels for men (cars, sports, football), or for women (fashion etc.)

 - it is hard to do sciency stuff, it is easier to produce 'content', therefore there are many news or politics channels. Some are being rage-baity, or doom oriented

 - there is a lot of entertainment channels (mr-beat like entertainment), movie and cinema related news channels, music bands

 - it is surprising that some of the entertainment are so much more 'popular' than established media. For example masha the bear channel dwarfs CNN

 - many of channels I see for the first time in my life. Google, or YouTube keeps us in a bubble of our countries, it is hard to see anything outside of it. For example I have never heard about Indian Hacker, or Bispo Bruno Leonardo

 - most often followers do not accept alternative, or opposing views
