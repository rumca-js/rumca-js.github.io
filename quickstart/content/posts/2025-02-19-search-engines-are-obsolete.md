Let’s run an experiment.

Start tracking the sites you visit manually. Where have you been today? This month?

Most likely, your browsing habits follow a predictable pattern:

 - You watch a YouTube video, maybe checking your favorite channels.
 - Or perhaps you don’t even have subscriptions—you just watch whatever "the algorithm" serves up.
 - You check what's new on Reddit or Rumble to stay updated.
 - Occasionally, you visit mainstream news sites like BBC, CNN, or a tech blog.
 - You scroll through Facebook to see what friends and family are up to.

And that’s about it.

You don’t really "surf the web." You follow a well-worn path.

Some might argue:
 - "But I search for restaurants!" - Do you, though? Or do you just check Google Maps or Facebook for recommendations? You’re not really using a search engine—you’re using a maps engine or a social media engine.
 - "But I look up how to do things!" - Are you sure? Or do you just ask ChatGPT instead of searching through pages of results?


The internet is vast, yet we keep circling the same familiar sites, guided by algorithms rather than curiosity. The open web—where people freely explored, discovered new blogs, and stumbled upon niche communities—feels like a relic of the past.

Have we stopped surfing the web? Or has the web stopped being a place worth surfing?
