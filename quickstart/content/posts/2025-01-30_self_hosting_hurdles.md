I recently came across a Reddit comment about RSS clients that caught my attention.

```
Sadly the easy solutions aren't open source and the self hosted ones don't seem to be worth the hassle to set up 
```

At first, I was surprised—self-hosting has always felt trivial to me.

But is it really?

I am a programmer, I am comfortable with tech. What about people who have only smartphones and do not know what is a script?

What makes self-hosting difficult then?

 - requires a PC - the amount of people who 'do not need it' is growing
 - requires having a Linux machine - Many people only use Windows or macOS
 - requires docker - Installation is often done through commandline, requires adding priviliges, groups, etc.
 - requires a UI for docker - Tools like Portainer, LazyDocker, but they're still an extra step

Once those hurdles are cleared, self-hosting is simple. But for many, those initial steps are what make it feel impossible.

# Therefore what would solve these problems?

A machine, dedicated to self-hosting, with a Linux image preinstalled with Docker and ready-to-use apps for ‘normies.’

Imagine booting up a system that just works, offering:

 - Nextcloud
 - Immich
 - Jellyfin
 - Hoarder
 - Paperless
 - TinyTinyRSS - with some RSS feeds pre-set
