[Verse 1]
I remember the days,
When I could send a pic, be free, no haze.
No eyes watchin’ from the screen,
No towers fallin’ in the scene.
Back when email felt sincere,
And freedom wasn’t laced with fear.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Call it the Patriot Act.
Eyes wide open, facts abstract—
Now they scan every move, every chat.

[Verse 2]
I need to see what you write,
Every message, every byte.
Let me scan, let me store,
Every thought behind your door.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Name it Child Safety Act.
Tell the public, “It's for kids,”
Then trade their rights for fibs.

[Verse 3]
Protect the children, yeah, that’s the pitch,
While privacy falls into a ditch.
What’s more sacred than the youth?
That’s how they disguise the truth.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Cyber Safety, that's the trap.
You like me now?
We’re all suspects on the map.

[Verse 4]
You a threat, I’m a threat—
Where’s your bomb? Where’s your net?
Better show some ID quick,
Or you ain’t browsing, not one click.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Encryption’s under attack.
No code too tight, no data black,
They want the keys, they want it back.

[Verse 5]
Need an ID? Better comply.
Without it, memes just pass you by.
No log-in, no access pass,
No freedom in this data class.

[Hook]
Wrap it up, wrap it up,
Terms of Use got you tagged.
Email, shoe size, DNA swag—
We track you now... uh, I mean "flag."

[Outro – Spoken Word Vibe]
Security they say...
But freedom don’t come wrapped in flags or fear.
It comes raw. It comes clear.
They wrapping it up—
But we see through the seal.
