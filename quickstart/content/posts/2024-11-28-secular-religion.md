I recently listened to ["We Are Living in an Idiocracy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71rPgqTvx40) by Asmongold TV. It resonated deeply with thoughts I’ve been having for a while, which is why I decided to share my perspective here.

That said, I believe the title is somewhat misleading. This isn’t just about idiocracy but rather the rise of what feels like a new kind of "cult" or "secular religion" within our society. As a religious person, I’ve noticed this pattern emerging repeatedly, and it has been on my mind for some time.

Some of these thoughts were also sparked by reading portions of the Unabomber manifesto, particularly sections 213 to 230, which touch on similar ideas. [Manifesto itself](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/unabom-manifesto-1.html).

Similarities between cults and today's 'secular religion':

 - Dogma and intolerance of criticism - In today’s society, certain topics are nearly impossible to discuss because of the rigid convictions people hold. For example, during Joe Biden’s presidency, some were utterly convinced that criticisms about his age were politically motivated. Yet, when it became undeniable that he was indeed old, many still refused to acknowledge it. This illustrates a broader social unwillingness to engage with inconvenient truths, even when backed by evidence.
 - Unreasonable fears of "the other" - There is an increasing tendency to cast opposing groups as existential threats. For instance, one side may claim, “The right-wing wants to take away our freedoms,” while the other side insists, “The LGBT community wants to indoctrinate our children.” These fears often lack a rational basis but gain traction through polarization.
 - Isolation fostering cult-like behavior - Social media has created echo chambers, isolating individuals into ideological bubbles. This amplifies groupthink and deepens division.
 - Existence of saints, Martyrdom of controversial figures - The death of George Floyd, for instance, was widely commemorated as that of a martyr. While his death highlighted systemic issues, it’s also true that he had a complicated history, including struggles with addiction and a criminal record. Yet, any nuanced discussion of this is often met with hostility, as though acknowledging imperfection diminishes the cause.
 - Perpetual guilt and unworthiness - In some circles, there’s a pervasive sense that you can never truly be "good enough." Concepts like "white privilege," "heteropatriarchy," or being born into oppressive systems create a sense of original sin that’s difficult to atone for.
 - Attributing intent based on group identity - People frequently assume their "side" has pure intentions, while the "other side" is driven by malice. This black-and-white thinking fuels division.
 - The necessity of a villain, satan - As in Orwell’s 1984, where "Big Brother" needed Goldstein as a perpetual enemy, modern groups often rely on a symbolic "bad guy" to rally against, a deamonic personality. This could be figures like George Soros for one side or Donald Trump for the other. These figures are demonized to sustain group cohesion.
 - Displays of moral affiliation - Just as Christians wear crosses to signify their faith, modern movements have their own symbols—pride flags, marches, awareness months, and celebrations—which serve as visible declarations of allegiance to a cause.
 - Evangelical zeal to impose morality - Similar to devout religious individuals who often steer conversations toward imposing their moral framework, many social movements exhibit a need to "spread the message." Discussions often pivot to teaching others the "correct" way to think or act, frequently accompanied by a sense of moral superiority. This is particularly evident in movements like DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), which sometimes resemble a form of modern church—a space where adherents can gather, communicate, and reaffirm shared values and beliefs.
 - Rituals - once a year you can celebrate leftism, like in pride month, where you are expected to attend, and hereby feel good about yourself
 - Witchhunts, inquisition - There is a lot of searching for "inequalities" in our society. Some try to find the source of evil. Potentially everybody is a suspect. If religious zealot claim you are a 'witch', you are being persecuted, and burned (cancel culture)
