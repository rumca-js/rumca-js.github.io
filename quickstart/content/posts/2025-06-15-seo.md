SEO is an art of positioning pages in Google search results. For most people, it is magic. Everyone knows the concept from the output side of things:

```
Yeah, just make my page rank higher.
```

This is not trivial because Google — or any other search engine — does not provide a clean and clear formula for how links are positioned. That’s what makes it the art of guessing. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle that changes shape every few months.

Google also does not want bad actors to use their engine to position malware or spam too high, so they intentionally obscure the exact mechanisms behind ranking. If everyone knew how Google positions links, it would be much easier to trick the system, manipulate visibility, and degrade search quality for everyone.

# Terminology

 - SEO – Search Engine Optimization; the practice of improving web pages to rank better in search engines.
 - Backlinks – Roughly, the number of times other sites link to yours. A critical trust signal.
 - Domain Credibility – A measure of how trustworthy and authoritative your entire domain is.
 - PageRank – One of Google’s original algorithms for ranking pages, based on link structure and quality.

# Previously

In the early days, backlinks were generated by link farms—networks of low-quality sites created solely to provide backlinks to each other. These artificially boosted a site’s “popularity,” tricking early versions of Google’s algorithm.

But this tactic had a short shelf life. Google’s systems quickly evolved to detect and penalize such manipulative practices. Today, excessive low-quality backlinks are more likely to hurt you than help.

# What’s Important

You cannot create a low-effort site and expect good results. Google's bots analyze your content in-depth. The content must follow modern web standards, be properly structured, and include key metadata such as title tags, alt text, and social media descriptions.

It’s not just about stuffing keywords anymore. It’s about solving the user’s problem better than anyone else. This includes:

 - Clean, fast-loading pages
 - Mobile responsiveness
 - Original, well-researched content
 - Clear headings and hierarchy
 - Easy-to-read formatting

Google pays close attention to how users interact with your site:

 - Do they bounce quickly?
 - Do they scroll and stay?
 - Do they click through other pages?

A high bounce rate or poor engagement sends a strong signal that your page might not be delivering value. UX, site speed, navigation clarity, and even visual aesthetics play a big role here.
Technical SEO

Behind the scenes, a lot matters:

 - Proper use of tags (meta, header, canonical, etc.)
 - A sitemap that bots can crawl
 - No broken links or 404 errors
 - Fast page load times
 - HTTPS security
