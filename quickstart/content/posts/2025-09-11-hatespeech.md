I have learned something today.

There are so many efforts to ban hate speech. It was all due to hate towards LGTB communities, and minorities.

I see currently how on Reddit everybody hates on dead republican Charlie Kirk.

So much for hatespeech online. Only certain 'casts' of people are protected. The desired outcome by ruling class is protected.
