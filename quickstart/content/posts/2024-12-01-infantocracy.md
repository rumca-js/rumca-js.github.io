I don’t think we’re living in an idiocracy; rather, we’re in an infantocracy. Much of the forcefully imposed DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) discourse seems to arise from this cultural shift.

Many people today may reach adulthood physically, but they often lack maturity due to a lack of significant hardship. This absence of resilience leaves them fragile, narcissistic, entitled, and overly demanding—traits that earn them the term “snowflakes.”

These individuals bring these tendencies into the workforce, creating an environment prone to unnecessary drama. They are so emotionally fragile that they "melt down" over even minor inconveniences. Their vulnerability leads them to fear opposing viewpoints or uncomfortable realities, which is why they often seek to dominate or control discussions.

The continuous state of being vulnerable leads to continues feeling of victimhood and abuse. "I am so fragile that I see micro agressions everywhere". I cannot fight myself, therefore I seek a parental figure. The parental figure needs to 'fix things'. Therefore 'snowflakes' seek government bodies, or company HR offices to help them. This enforces the incapability, because 'snowflakes' do not resolve issues, they just delegate resolution of problems to government bodies.

In extreme cases, they may escalate conflicts into legal action, claiming companies fail to adequately represent minorities or other groups. To avoid such risks, organizations often preemptively create hyper-sensitive environments, DEI offices, more focused on shielding themselves from lawsuits than addressing any real systemic problems.

This not only alters workplace dynamics but also makes them highly susceptible to manipulation. They often become activists for "good causes," driven more by emotion than experience. Fueled by what some might call a "mind virus," they are quick to fight perceived injustices, such as microaggressions or inequalities, even when these issues are imagined or exaggerated. Ironically, many of these individuals lack meaningful accomplishments—they have not built businesses, led organizations, or earned their authority through merit. Yet they confidently assert how things "should be."

Some may attribute this text as 'right wing', or giving it other 'labels'. This is not however about 'left' or 'right', but about 'snowflakes'. Obviously you can be a 'right wing' snoflake.
