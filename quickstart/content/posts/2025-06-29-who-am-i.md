[Verse 1]
I click and I scroll, a thousand eyes blink back
In this neon tundra, my voice gets lost in the stack
I reach for someone — just code and static light
Where is the real in this infinite byte?

Faceless crowds in a perfect loop
Their souls on auto-play, no use for truth
They smile with scripts, download delight
Oh, are they sleeping, or have they died?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm infinite, they said — just plug me in!
Neurons braided tight with corporate skin
I float — an angel on a monthly fee
(Subscription ends... do I cease to be?)

[Chorus]
Who am I?
A thought between two satellites
Am I mine?
Or leased like morning light?
Upload my tears,
Will the cloud know how I cry?
Who am I?
Or was I ever... I?

[Verse 2]
They sold me meaning in a mirrored cube
Wrapped in dopamine and sterile lube
No hunger, no risk — just “comfort design”
But I miss the ache of a faulty spine

They say we’ve won — no gods, no death
But I’m bored of breath that’s bought, not left
I miss the dirt, the messy ends
Not this polished echo of “transcend”

[Bridge – spoken/sung, robotic and eerie]
🜁 “You are safe. You are calm. Your identity is backed by blockchain.”
🜃 “Your purpose is compatible with advertising algorithms.”
🜂 “Your sadness has been auto-optimized.”
🜄 “You are free.”
...Repeat loop... Repeat loop... Repeat—

[Chorus]
Who am I?
Just a flicker in the machine’s sigh
Is this life?
Or a beta test gone awry?
They digitized
My soul before I could say goodbye
Who am I?
In a world that never asks why?

[Outro – ambient fade with disjointed melodies]
I am... the silence behind a screen
I am... the glitch inside a dream
I am... a ghost with terms and fees
I am... I am... maybe not even me
