Why You Should Share Your Links

Sharing and organizing links is more important than you might think. Here's why:

1. Your Knowledge is Valuable: You've likely visited interesting places online. Even if they seem obvious to you, others might find them invaluable.
2. For the Greater Good: By storing and sharing your links, you're creating a resource that benefits not just you, but also others who might need that information.
3. Avoid Closed Platforms: Storing your links on closed platforms limits their accessibility and portability. Ask yourself:
 - Can I easily share my links with anyone?
 - Can I export my links in a format that's easy to distribute?
4. Use Open Formats: Sharing links as files (like .zip) is versatile and ensures long-term usability.
5. The Need for Better Tools: A good link viewer should accept files and display the links clearly. Tools like these help make sharing links more practical and efficient.
