We fly a lot
To snowy peaks where we can plan and plot
(We fly a lot)
About emissions, ice caps melting fast
(We fly a lot)
But carbon offsets let us off the hook at last
(We fly a lot)
We sip champagne while talking climate stress
(We fly a lot)
And sell the future with an iPhone press
Yeah!

We fly a lot!
We Zoom a lot!
From five-star suites where revolutions rot
(We care a ton!)
About inclusion, gender, race, and rights
(While banning speech we didn't like last night)
We fund both sides!
We hedge our bets!
(Then write a thread on how to not oppress)

Yeah!
It’s a dirty game, but someone’s gotta play it
Well, it’s a dirty game, but someone’s gotta play it
Yeah, it’s a dirty game, but someone’s gotta play it
It’s a dirty game—guess who's getting paid?

(We pitch a lot)
About green tech, solar skies and hope
(While fracking stocks go vertical, no joke)
(We cry a lot)
At panels called The World We Need
Then party hard with arms deals overseas

We fly a lot!
To make you think this wasn’t bought and taught
(We march for peace!)
In branded boots and sponsored pride
(Then drone the poor who mustn't cross our side)
We stream our hearts!
In real-time feeds!
While data-mining every single need

Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

It’s a dirty job, but someone’s gotta brand it
Yeah, it’s a dirty gig, and someone’s gotta stand it
It’s a dirty script, but someone’s gotta chant it
It's a dirty world—and someone's gotta scan it

(We care a lot)
About the workers in the gig-based chain
(Just don’t ask where your parcel's been again)
We fund the truth!
We fight the hate!
(Unless it’s coming from our real estate)

We tweet a lot!
We lead a lot!
We’re brave and bold in keynote screenshot slots
We fly a lot!
We lie a lot!
We sell the change, and we charge you for the thought
Yeah!
