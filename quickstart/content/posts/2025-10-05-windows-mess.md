for long time windows was plug and play. 

on linux everything was difficult and required manual input

windows? after installation i had problems with running a game. required vc redistributable 2010.
my boy had problems with running old installer type passing through smart filters. asking permissions, how to find it, whay is reliable. source for. exe, some sites foind on google where spftonics tech content farms. 

linux also requirrs manual input often, but it is well documented, and. often more streamlined, and has better support for obsolete old games
