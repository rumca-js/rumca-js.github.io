For years, Windows was the go-to "just works" operating system. Plug something in, run an installer, play your game—simple. Meanwhile, Linux was for the patient and tech-savvy, often requiring manual configs and command-line tinkering.

But somewhere along the way, things changed.

# Windows: Familiar, But Fragmented

After a fresh Windows install, I tried launching an old game. It failed—missing Visual C++ Redistributable 2010. Finding the right version meant digging through sketchy download sites and dodging ad-ridden content farms.

My son ran into similar issues with an older .exe installer. Windows SmartScreen blocked it, demanding permissions with no clear option to proceed. Even figuring out a safe download source was a challenge.

This isn’t plug and play anymore. It’s plug and troubleshoot.

When I wanted to install Minecraft, one of the most popular games, I spent hour to configure account. I don't remember exactly why, but it had to do about sons account being restricted, I did not want to add online account into the system, online setup for micorsoft account could not reset my missing pin, and could not reset pin on machine because I was missing login credentials, etc.

All in all Microsoft push for online-only, to push features users don't like, and don't need result in half baked solutions, need to authenticate in many places, giving data about you.

# Linux: Still Manual, But Smarter

Linux used to be intimidating. Now, it’s often the more straightforward choice—especially for gaming.

Tools like:

 - Steam with Proton

 - Bottles

 - Lutris

make running Windows games easy and often more compatible than on modern Windows. Even old titles run better, thanks to Linux's focus on preserving legacy support rather than cutting it off.

# The Shift

Today:

 - Windows often requires digging through outdated dependencies and bypassing security roadblocks.

 - Linux may still involve manual steps, but they're usually well-documented and logical.

The myth that Windows "just works" and Linux doesn’t is getting harder to believe. In fact, for many use cases—especially gaming—Linux might now be the smoother ride.






for long time windows was plug and play. 

on linux everything was difficult and required manual input

windows? after installation i had problems with running a game. required vc redistributable 2010.
my boy had problems with running old installer type passing through smart filters. asking permissions, how to find it, whay is reliable. source for. exe, some sites foind on google where spftonics tech content farms. 

linux also requirrs manual input often, but it is well documented, and. often more streamlined, and has better support for obsolete old games
