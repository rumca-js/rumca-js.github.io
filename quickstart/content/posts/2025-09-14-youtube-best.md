 - I have been updating database of links
 - Until now the most viewed channel could have around 20M of followers in my database. I had maybe 200 channels
 - I found wikipedia page with the most subscribed to channels, Mr. Beast at the time of writing has 430M of followers
 - Most of these 'most subscribed to channels' are either aimed toward children, or mindless entertainment, waste of time. Something analogic to 'fast food'
 - Many originate from India, maybe not something particularly surprising since India demographic structure could indicate that
 - Many of channels are for kids. Unfortunately it seems that YouTube viewership consist of many small children. I think it could be connected with how modern upbringing looks like
 - I found it tragic that it is "YouTube's best"
