Today, I had an epiphany: I might not be as affected by AI-generated slop in search results as others.

I don’t rely much on algorithms. Doomscrolling is often filled with recommendations, ads, and AI-generated junk—but I don’t engage with it much.

By following RSS feeds, I get content directly from creators—no AI interference. And since I don’t depend on search as much, I avoid the problem altogether.

YouTube search is especially tragic, so having channels defined in a reader is so so much better experience.
