I found inner piece.

What has happened? What have you done? Have you left your technology behind, moved to a cabin and started life of a hermit?

No not at all.

I still watch youtube, I still use social media via reddit or hacker news.

I am just at peace with it.

It is surprising since many things appear to crumble. At least on media the go through Jeffrey Epstein pefophile stuff, and go through all his connections. For americans this sounds like end of the world.

I think that people fight because of lack of control over their life. People complain how governments control their life.

I have gone full RSS, I have my own search engine, I have my own digital walled garden. I read books.

I am connection, while being disconnected. Funny stuff, hard to describe. I read news as if it was a fantasy novel. I walk through life as a character in a book. My life is my family. My life is my neighbours. I watch news like a theater, because it is one.
