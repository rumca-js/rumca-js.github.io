[Intro: Spoken, over beat]
Yeah.
This for the ones caught scrollin’ through the noise.
Where facts get buried beneath the cash.
Where the loudest lies drown out the truth.
Where my science, bitch?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I step in the room like a peer-reviewed study,
Facts on my tongue, and my logic stay bloody,
They think 5G cookin’ brains, chemtrails in the rain,
Flat Earth theories like they never took a plane.

Ancient aliens? Nah, that’s just lazy,
Ignoring Black scholars, now that’s real crazy,
Vaccines got chips? Man, who paid you?
Facebook threads ain’t peer-reviewed.

Paid journals got a paywall guardin’ the gate,
But Big Pharma buyin’ space for the clickbait,
You read an article, but don’t check the source,
It was ghostwritten by a bot with no remorse.

[Chorus]
🎶 Where my science, bitch? Facts never flinch,
Truth gettin’ strangled by a corporate cinch.
Echoes in the net got your thoughts in a glitch,
Oil money talkin' with a poisonous pitch.

Where my science, bitch? Raise that lens,
Dissect the lies that the algorithm sends.
Propaganda slick with a Hollywood stitch,
But I stay rootin’ in that logic-rich niche. 🎶

[Verse 2]
They spinnin' like turbines, fossil fuel fables,
Oil execs fundin’ think tanks under tables,
“Climate change a myth” — that's the oldest con,
Meanwhile Earth’s sweatin’ like a marathon.

Russian bots flood feeds like a data tide,
Mask off, no truth on the other side,
Fake news travel fast, real facts take stairs,
But we stuck in bubbles, just shoutin’ to the air.

Lobbyists lurk like shadows in Congress,
Science gets silenced, truth gets modest,
They sell you supplements and pseudoscience,
While censorin’ reports that show defiance.

[Bridge: Slow, haunting beat shift]
AI ghostwriters pen fakes with flair,
No soul, no source, just vacuum air.
Scrollin’ through lies in your digital lair,
Who funds the doubt? Better ask, who cares?

[Verse 3]
They preach free speech, but fund deceit,
Buyin’ up truth, then water it weak.
Algorithms got you dancin' in loops,
Feelin’ woke in a hall of dupes.

Science ain't a vibe — it's method and grind,
Double-check the facts, don't follow the blind.
We need more Newtons, less TikTok priests,
More data, less vibes from conspiracy feasts.

[Chorus – Final Hook]
🎶 Where my science, bitch? Truth need a stage,
Break through the static, write facts on the page.
Troll farms lurkin’, pushin’ fake scripts,
But my brain stay sharp like a well-honed crypt.

Where my science, bitch? Ain’t no glitch,
I ride with the facts, make the narrative switch.
Echoes of reason, let the signal twitch,
If knowledge a weapon — I empty the clip. 🎶

[Outro – Spoken]
Read the source.
Question the cash.
Follow the method, not the mass.
Where my science, bitch?
