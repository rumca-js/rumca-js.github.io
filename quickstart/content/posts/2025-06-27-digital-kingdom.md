This was never about you or me
It ran too deep to ever see
We thought we were roaming free
Browsing life without a fee

You got nothing to hide
I got everything to lose
This ain’t a game—no second try
No respawn when the system dies

Look in the lens—don’t blink
Facebook whispers while you sleep
Watchers crawl beneath the screens
A kingdom born from data streams

Blind to the sins of your kingdom
Kings of servants, every whim at fingertips
Kings trapped in a golden cage
Servants to the digital state

You got nothing to hide!
I got everything to lose!
This ain’t a film with a happy end
It’s a black mirror—no pretend

The ads already know your name
Desire and shame—it’s all the same
The rise of the surveillance state
Emerging from the digital deep

You sit. You wait.
Conveniently browsing the web
We sold our freedom for ease
One-click gods—digital disease

Notifications. Dopamine.
Chains you wear but never see

Sit. Scroll. Obey.
Welcome to your Judgment Day
Speak—and it's forever stored
Every thought becomes the sword

This is what you wanted
This is what you chose
This is what you ignored
This is what you agreed
This is what you get

You had nothing to hide...
Now there’s nothing left
