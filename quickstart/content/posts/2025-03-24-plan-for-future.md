My plan is to provide RSS reader / Internet command center.

My plan is to keep providing bookmarks:
 - music I like
 - bookmarks
 - books I like
 - movies I like
 - all domains database, with votes, and tags

I shall continue creating lists "awesome lists". There should be something like awesome list editor, that is capable of checking link consistency.

Problems:
 - I do not have yet books / movies database
 - I am not sure towards which things I should point in books, or movies (imdb? metacritic?)
 - I fear that more spam will enter domains database
