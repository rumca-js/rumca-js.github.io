🎵 "Wow, I Did That (With One Button)" 🎵
Genre: Clueless Pop Banger / Overconfidence Core

[Verse 1]
I clicked one thing — the screen went ding
Now there’s a cat that raps and sings.
It blinked once, then spun around,
I stood up fast and screamed, “I’M PROFOUND!”

I made a square that kinda moves,
I watched it twice — now I approve.
Didn’t learn, didn’t sweat,
But I’m the smartest human yet.

[Chorus]
🎶 Wow, I did that — with one button!
Einstein’s quaking, he’s like “What’s happenin’?”
Mozart weeps, “That’s better than Bach!”
It’s just one beep and a spinning sock.
Wow, I did that — no clue how!
I’m Shakespeare now — just with fewer vowels.
I dropped my drink, then pressed the key —
And birthed pure creativity. 🎶

[Verse 2]
Tesla built a coil with sparks,
I made a fart noise that leaves marks.
Da Vinci painted flying men —
I made a fish that screams “Amen.”

I don’t code, I don’t compose,
But I made a gif of a dancing nose.
My friend said, “That’s not hard to do,”
But I said, “Jealousy doesn’t look good on you.”

[Chorus]
🎶 Wow, I did that — with just one press!
I outsmarted Newton, more or less.
I clicked ‘Generate’ and changed the world —
Then watched it loop while my toes curled.
Wow, I did that — call the Louvre!
My jellybean poem just found its groove.
It makes no sense, but that’s the art —
I’m a genius with a broken cart. 🎶

[Bridge – Spoken, passionately clueless]
I didn’t make the tool.
I didn’t build the system.
But I pressed the button.
And honestly… that feels like enough.

[Verse 3 – slow and dramatic]
They say real skill takes years of grind,
But I made clouds shaped like my mind.
They kinda look like mashed-up frogs…
Still better than your blog.

[Final Chorus]
🎶 Wow, I did that — I'm a prodigy!
This JPEG owl is my legacy.
The greats had paint, or notes, or math —
I had Wi-Fi and a clicky path.
Wow, I did that — and I’ll do it again,
Even if it’s nonsense with a dolphin pen.
One button, baby — that’s my muse,
Now excuse me while I auto-fuse. 🎶

[Outro – softly, fading like a confused king]
No one knows how I did it...
Because I don’t either.
Wow… I am amazing.
