[Verse 1]
Can you tolerate me
When I am wrong, when I ask?
Can you hear a broken thought
Without reaching for the mask?

Call me a troll.
Call me a threat.
Labels before
You take a breath.

The things I say
Get nuked to hell
No grace, no pause —
Why? I coulnd't tell

[Verse 2]
I just got banned —
No warning, no trial
Just silence and shame
For going the mile

Media flows
Like a guided flood
It shapes the war
It draws the blood

Controlling the trends
Boosting the hate
Monetize your mind
Before it’s too late

[Bridge 1]
boost the anger
boost the engagement
boost the profit
boost the shareholder value

Rage is the rhythm
Hate is the stage
Truth is treason
Doubt is rage

[Bridge 2]
Mob in motion
Facts be damned
Don’t ask questions —
Take a stand

You're in or out
You speak or break
You toe the line
Or you're the fake

[Spoken Interlude]
"You bigot,"
"You leftist,"
"You commie,"
"You gooner,"
"You incel,"
"You brainrot."
Just words now.
Just swords now.

Passive agressive,
Love censorship.
Snarky tone,
Feeling so better
Oblivious to others —
Pride swinging like a cock.

[Chorus]
I hate you! For saying it straight
I hate you! For not choosing sides
I hate you! For not being aligned

Your facts are flames, and I’m the straw
You judge with ease, you see every flaw
You can shame me, name me
Push me off the edge and blame me

[Chorus – Repeat/Alt]
I hate you! For not picking sides
I hate you! For where the truth hides
I hate you! Because I can’t explain
Why I feel this fire when you speak my pain
So shame me, blame me
There’s no place left to claim me

Russia burns the eagle
With digital gas
Memes like missiles
Buried in laughs

Bots in swarms
Feed the divide
Comedy’s cover
For chaos inside
Your hate is the match
Their reach is the wind
Burning down borders
From deep within

[Outro]
No middle ground
No time to wait
No room for doubt
Just love or hate
And when you choose
Don’t hesitate
Or they’ll come for you
And it’s too late.
