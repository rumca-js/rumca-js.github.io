I already wrote that I hate "The algorithm", which big tech is using to spoon feed you informarmation.

The most, I hate that they treat you like a baby, make you passive, where you should 'hunt for information'.

Recently I had to stop using reddit, because they started serving me girls. They showed me more and more pictures of women. Yes, they were pretty, but I am not using reddit to watch content like that.

I tried marking some of this stuff as "not something I would like to see" through menus, but it works like hydra.

I mark one subreddit, two more are shown to me.

I had to revert to my RSS reader because of that. Fuck big tech.
