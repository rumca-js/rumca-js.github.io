Why I Disagree with the Saying: "If You're Not Interested in Politics, Politics Will Still Affect You"

I don’t like this saying, and here’s why:

 - It's False. Lets reverse the logic. What happens if you are interested in Politics. It affects you. What happens if you are not interested in Politics? It affects you. So no matter what you do the Politics affects you. The statements create illusion that your interest makes a difference
 - Interest in Politics is Not a Necessity. Not everyone needs to be interested in politics, just like not everyone needs to be an expert in medicine. Medicine is useful because people get sick, but not everyone has to be a doctor to survive. Similarly, not everyone is suited to be an expert in politics. It’s just one of many fields that impact life, but it doesn’t mean that everyone needs to dive deep into it.
 - Becoming an Expert in Politics Requires a Lot of Effort. To be an expert in politics, you need to dedicate time, research, and patience. You also need to listen to a lot of bad arguments, harsh criticisms, and engage with unpleasant people. I’m not interested in participating in discussions where everything devolves into yelling and hostility. This is not a space where I wish to spend my time.
 - Much of Politics is a Puppet Show. Often, what we see in the media is a performance. Politicians argue on-screen, but behind the scenes, many of them are likely meeting up in private, making deals, and sipping drinks. The public is often being misled, and it can be hard to distinguish what's real from what's fabricated. I vividly remember when Klaus Schwabb bragged online that his buddies infiltrated many politicians cabinets. It is all big boys club
 - Politically Obsessed People Try to Pressure Others. Many times, this saying comes from people who are “political enthusiasts” or “political hooligans”—those who are so obsessed with politics that they want to make others feel bad for not sharing the same level of interest. These individuals often try to shame others for not being as deeply involved as they are, which isn’t helpful.
  - Politics Often Feels Like No Real Choice. In many political systems, you only get to vote once every few years. However, voting can feel like signing a blank check. You give someone power, but you have no control over their actual decisions once they're in office. This leads to power misuse and a sense of helplessness. You might vote for a president promising change, but after elections, they may do something entirely different. Believing in this system can be naive. Your interest may not affect in any way decision of a politician
 - Knowledgeable Participation is Important, but Not Expertise. I agree that people should be knowledgeable enough to prevent bad actors from gaining power. However, this doesn’t mean you need to be a political expert to have an impact. The power we have is in voting wisely, not in becoming a political authority ourselves.

## A Bad-Faith Joke

Here's another example of how political disengagement is often misrepresented:
 - Two people are on a train to a concentration camp. One asks the other, “Which camp are you being assigned to?” The second replies, “I’m not interested in politics.”
 - The problem here is that both men are being sent to the camp. It's important to know where you're going, but at the same time, sometimes ignorance is bliss. You might be better off not worrying about what tomorrow brings.
 - In real life, it’s often better not to dwell too much on problems, as it can lead to depression and health issues. Leading your life with good faith and optimism is often healthier than obsessing over what you can’t control.
 - This analogy oversimplifies politics and life. Life isn’t so black and white. Most people are aware of who their president is, even if they don’t follow every detail of political debate.

## The Case of the Paris Electric Scooter Referendum

Regarding the recent poll in Paris on electric scooters:

 - A poll was conducted, but only a small portion of the population participated.
 - most of voters opposed the scooters, but the majority of citizens were upset because the vote effectively blocked the scooters.
 - If more people had voted, the results would likely have been different.

 - This scenario is often used to emphasize the importance of voting. While I agree that if you want something to happen, you should participate rather than rely on pre-poll data, there's a flaw in the system.
 - but...  If only 10% of people vote, then my participation doesn't make a difference. The majority always determines the outcome, not me.

In Conclusion

 - Voting and Participation Give the Illusion of Impact. Voting may give you a sense that you’ve made a difference, but it often doesn’t change much at all. If voting really changed anything, it would likely be banned. Systemic change requires significant investment, and attempting to alter a “bad” system may only end up causing more harm.
