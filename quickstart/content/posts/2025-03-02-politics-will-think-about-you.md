I do not like this saying.

 - mostly because it is false. Politics will do you whatever you do. Whether you are interested in it, or not, the politics will do you
 - being interested in politics is false. Not everybody has to be interested in medicine, yet everybody is ill from time to time. There are many fields which are really useful in life. Politics is just one of them, and not everybody is suited to be expert in that field. Not everybody will be expert
 - being expert in politics requires a lot of effort. It requires you also to listen to really bad arguments, and really bad people. You have to listen to yelling. I do not wish to participate in discussions like that
 - often what is shown to us is just a puppet show. There are many things that are done behind the scenes. Deals. Businesses. Politicians argue on screen, just to meet in restaurant and get drunk. Often you are being fooled, and it is really hard to tell what is real and what is not
 - this is often said by people who are "politic hooligans", by your uncle who is really interested in politics. They are obsessed with politics, and they want to make you feel bad, for not being interested in politics as they are
 - politics often boils down to no choice. You have for every several years ability to vote. This operates however like a blank check. You give somebody power, yet you have no control over the decision making. This in effect leads to misuse of power. This is not a good design of political system. The participating user has no real impact on reality. We can control people, but not their decisions. Therefore you can pick president who says he will do something, but after elections he might also not do anything at all, or do something entirely different. Belief in that system is naive
 - I agree that participant of the system should be knowledgable, and should vote in a way to prevent bad actors from obtaining the power, but that is all the power we have. Therefore you do not have to be an expert in politics to prevent bad actors from maintaing the power

One another example of bad faith joke is:
 - two guys are going on a train, sent to concentration camp. One asks the other "To which camp you are being assigned to?", to what the one responds "I am not interested in politics"
 - the problem is that both men are being transported to concentration camp. It is important to know in which you end up with, but on the other hand, who cares. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. Sometimes you are better of not knowing what tommorow brings
 - in real life it is often better not to think about problems too much. This leads to depression and health problems. It is better to lead life with good faith, and by being relatively optimistic
 - this oversimplifies approach to politics, and to life. Life does not look like that in reality. Most people know who their president is

Concerning poll results in France/Paris, about electric scooter [1](https://citychangers.org/e-scooters-referendum-paris/)
 - there was a poll about electric scotters
 - only small amount of people came to vote
 - 90% of those were against scooters
 - majority of citizens were not happy because the vote blocked electric scotters
 - if more people came to vote, the results would be different
 - this scenario is often brought up, about the necessity of voting
 - while I agree, that if you want something to be done, you should go, and not rely on pre-poll data
 - on the other hand if 10% of people comes to vote, then my participation does not make any difference. Always majority selects outcome, not me.

To sum up
 - participation in voting gives you illusion that 'you made a difference'
 - if voting was changing anything, then voting would be banned. On the other hand drastic changes to the 'system' requires a lot of money, and often breaks things. Changing a 'bad system' may break things more
