# The problem with technlogy future

Technology is becoming one of the fundamental problems of the future. It is no longer just a tool but a means of spreading influence and control.
This is why companies have embraced SaaS and subscription-based models — they allow them to maintain continuous control over their users.

In an environment dominated by technology, you are merely a cog in the machine.

The entire system has become hive-oriented. In every hive, there is a queen and the workers. In human society, this translates to the bourgeoisie — the elite, the powerful — and everyone else.

In the past, there were barons, kings, and hierarchies. Today, we have a near two-tier system: the controllers and the controlled.

Escaping the system is nearly impossible. To participate in society, you must be part of it. You must serve the queen.

# Breakdown

## Monopoly of Power (IT)
Technological solutions tend to centralize, giving rise to massive corporations and monopolies.

## Total AI controler
AI increasingly dictates decision-making, and people follow it blindly. AI will be smarter than most of us, so we will become even more susceptible to manipulation.

## Transhumanism
A full embrace of technology threatens to diminish the human aspects of life and identity.

# Deeper Breakdown

- **Platform Monopoly:** A few platforms decide what is visible and what is hidden, extending their power over public perception.
- **Brain Interfaces & Body Augmentation: **As the human body becomes integrated with technology, autonomy erodes — you are no longer free if your body or mind can be remotely controlled or modified.
- **Synthetic Reality:** Life becomes increasingly replaced by virtual experiences — video games, VR, AR, and social media — blurring the line between reality and simulation.
- **Technological Sexuality:** Human intimacy is replaced or augmented by artificial means.
- **Subscription Models Everywhere:** Ownership gives way to endless rent — even access to tools and knowledge becomes temporary.
- **Cultural Passivity:** When technology provides everything, people lose initiative and purpose. They serve the needs of technology rather than the other way around.
- **Killer Machines:** Autonomous war drones and AI-guided weapons redefine warfare and morality.
- **Social Conditioning:** Social media acts as a digital Skinner box — people self-censor, policing their own thoughts and expressions to align with algorithmic norms.

# The Technological Dictatorship

What looks like a technological "hive" may not be a single conscious dictator but an emergent system — a combination of commercial incentives, network effects, algorithmic architectures, and legal frameworks that concentrate influence.  
This system shapes beliefs and behavior not by force, but by subtly reorganizing incentives and attention.

These systems are often guided by a small oligarchy of powerful tech elites — the so-called “tech bros” like Zuckerberg or Musk.  

People, however, are not as mindless as bees, so the system requires a well-crafted propaganda machine and an ideology that enforces complacency.

This will take the form of technological evangelism — a belief system that ensures people follow the technological dictatorship. Like all propaganda, it will have its scapegoats and rely on shaming those who resist or deviate.

To suppress human emotion, new solutions will emerge. Perhaps a modern “soma” will appear, or maybe the widespread social isolation of our times will prove sufficient.

To deepen social division, new laws will discourage genuine human contact — relationships will become liabilities, and even accusations could destroy a person’s life.

# A World Where Everything Counts

For years, corporations have been capturing data about their users. At first, it was only the necessary data — but the scope expanded relentlessly.

Imagine a world where everything you do is tracked, stored, and maintained for future analysis.  
Each year, the net tightens.

As long as we remain useful to “the queen,” this surveillance may seem benign. But as systems grow more invasive, abuses will become inevitable. Some will not notice because they are complacent or ideologically aligned with the system.

There will be little compassion for those who refuse to conform or wish to live outside the hive.

# Escape

Escape will be difficult. Technology is convenient and networked by design; opting out means losing access to jobs, services, and social life. Open-source and self-hosted alternatives exist, but they rarely match the convenience, polish, or funding of mainstream offerings, so adoption stays limited. Cultural inertia and short time horizons make it unlikely that most people will voluntarily choose harder, less integrated options.

People often fail to see the dangers of technology until it’s too late.

# The need for control

That said, not all control is bad. Institutions, regulations, and shared norms are necessary to prevent harm and coordinate complex societies.  

The challenge is to design governance that protects individual autonomy, limits centralized power, and keeps technological systems transparent and accountable.

Control is necessary — but who controls the controllers?  
At present, no one. Tech elites can act as they please, influencing the lives of millions with minimal oversight.
