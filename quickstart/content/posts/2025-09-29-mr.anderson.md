So I have seen two things happen:
 - UK pushes for digital ID, to be used
 - Google requires government ID for any app to be used on certified Android device

My Reddit response for the latter situation:

```
"The system" will eventually create a clear, visible divide between digital spaces: one for compliant citizens, and another for digital nomads, pirates, and freedom-seekers.

This will lead to a dual existence, Mr. Anderson - one life under a digital ID, where you're a law-abiding citizen in a controlled, sanitized environmentâ€¦ and another life in freer, unregulated spaces, where censorship is minimal and you can install and say what you want - but at your own risk.

The border will be moved every year. Goal posts will be shifted. The freedom will be taken away, one step after another. Most people will comply, because they do not really care. They care about bank access, ability to view new mr.beast videos. They will complain, but they will comply.
