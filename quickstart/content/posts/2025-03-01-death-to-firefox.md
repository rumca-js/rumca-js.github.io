Recently because of changes to Mozilla TOS I decided to switch browsers.

I thought that nothing will change.

I was wrong.

Granted I switched to "waterfox".

Differences below
 - it allows me to add a custom search engine. Fuck. Why Mozilla. Why did you block adding custom search engines? Has Google paid enough for you to block it?
 - no pocket nagging. I do not use pocket for bookmarks. I use my own bookmarks. So many times I have incorrectly clicked context menu entry...

These two reasons are already big enough for me, to be able to tell that SOMETHING is already bad in decision making. Their decicisions are toward big corporations, subscriptions, etc.

I want a tool, not an ad tool.

... and I have one conclusion. Waterfox cannot be too successful.

Lets play imagine game.

 - waterfox gets popular
 - firefox stops being more popular than waterfox
 - mozilla does not want to invest and work on firefox as much
 - progress of waterfox gets stifled

Progress of waterfox depends on firefox.
