I wrote a page with links in it. I hoard links. I have many links.

I tried advertising it on reddit, with some limited positive feedback, and I am a little bit surprised.

Google is potemkin village. You will not find these links using it. So why people are not interested?

I have some thoughts:

 - maybe my lists are all garbage. Not all links are relevent. It is hard to create SEO index, and position things nicely
 - my UI might scare people off
 - internet is already dead. Nobody cares about links. People are on social media, and boomer internet is doomed
 - people do not care. They are accustomed know to ever working "the algorithm" which spoonfeds you with information. Would you like to search for info yourself, or is it easier just to doom scroll? Have people become NPCs?
