        <p>write a pop song about para social relationship between female youtuber, and audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is fake love</li>
<li>you can make a metaphor that you cannot be happy with fake love, just as you cannot be healthy with junk food</li>
<li>you have to write in chorus youtuber words like &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, but finishing line with her not knowing name of audience, or finishing it with &ldquo;but pay me first&rdquo;</li>
<li>she knows how to keep him around, maybe because her boyfriend tells her</li>
<li>she sells merch, it is just business</li>
<li>user deep down recognized this, but cannot have love in real world</li>
</ul>
<p>pop, glossy, hollow, and calculated, sweet female voice</p>
<p>🎵 Title: “YouTuber Love”
(From the YouTuber&rsquo;s perspective — glossy, hollow, and calculated)</p>
<p>[Verse 1]
I press record, the mask goes on
Red light’s blinking — now I’m gone
You think you see the realest me
But baby, I’m who you want me to be</p>
<p>A little flirty, just enough
Soft voice, hard sell, sugar stuff
I sell a dream, you pay to stay
But none of it is real, okay?</p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus]
My lashes fake, my tears are too
It’s all for clicks — not just for you
You think we’re close, but truth is worse
This love comes with a credit curse</p>
<p>[Chorus]
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I whisper sweet
While cash rolls in beneath my feet
But love like this, it doesn&rsquo;t burst
You want my heart? Then pay me first
Like junk food highs that never last
You’ll crash and crave the moment past
I’d say your name, if you meant more&hellip;
But I forget it like the one before</p>
<p>[Verse 2]
I know your type — the quiet kind
Lost in screens, in need of signs
You think our bond is something deep
But I sell comfort you can’t keep</p>
<p>Each “like” you leave, each gift you send
Just buys another round of pretend
You want connection, warm and true
But baby, I don’t even know you</p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus]
I&rsquo;m just as fake as my contour
A painted smile, nothing more
You want the girl behind the glow?
She’s not someone I let show</p>
<p>[Chorus]
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; it’s my favorite line
A trick that keeps your heart in mine
But this ain’t love, it’s well-rehearsed
You want a soul? Then pay me first
Like fast food love, it leaves you sick
You chase the high, but it won’t stick
I’d call you mine, say something true&hellip;
But there’s too many just like you</p>
<p>[Bridge]
You think you’re different — I play along
That’s the hook in every song
But when the lights go out, I fade
Just a shadow in the masquerade</p>
<p>[Final Chorus]
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you need to hear
While I collect your cash and cheer
But baby, don’t confuse the thirst
For something real — just pay me first
Like candy hearts that rot your teeth
This fake affection lies beneath
I’d know your name if it were real…
But love’s not part of this deal</p>
<p>[Outro]
So here’s your smile, your little taste
A perfect lie in glitter paste
You want the truth? It might hurt…
You fell in love —
but I sold it first.</p>
<p>🎵 Title: “Add to Cart”
(Perspective: female YouTuber — flirty, polished, calculated)</p>
<p>[Verse 1]
I hit “Go Live,” and there you are
Same sad eyes, same avatar
You type, “You&rsquo;re all I’ve got tonight”
I smile and dim the ring light right</p>
<p>You think this love is somethin’ deep
But baby, I don’t lose sleep
I know exactly what to do
And yeah — he tells me what keeps you glued</p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus]
He says, “Bite your lip, then pause and blink
Make them feel close, but never think
Too much truth just breaks the spell
Keep it cute, and sell it well”</p>
<p>[Chorus]
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I say on cue
You buy the words like they’re brand new
But sugar love will rot you first
You want my heart? Then pay me first
You&rsquo;re craving me like junk food bites
Feels good now, but not at night
I’d say your name, make it sincere…
But I don’t know it — just your tier</p>
<p>[Verse 2]
You bought the hoodie, signed in pink
I saw the order — didn’t blink
I sent a kiss, a winky face
You screenshot it and call it fate</p>
<p>But baby, I’ve got bills to pay
And fake love prints in better gray
It’s not romance, it’s just a pitch
With checkout buttons you can’t quit</p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus]
He whispers, “Drop a tear, then laugh
They eat it up, do all the math
Show them just enough to feel
Then remind them what is real&hellip;”</p>
<p>[Chorus]
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I purr and sway
You stay subscribed another day
But love like this — it’s more rehearsed
You want it real? Then pay me first
You feed on me like midnight fries
Feels warm now, but it won’t satisfy
I’d hold your hand, but that’s not me…
I’ve got a boyfriend off-screen, see?</p>
<p>[Bridge]
This isn’t cruel — it’s business, babe
You clicked accept when I pressed play
You wanted love? You bought a brand
You never saw the sleight of hand</p>
<p>[Final Chorus]
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I say once more
As you reload the merch page store
But junk food hearts just leave you cursed
You want my love? Then pay me first
You binge on me, then feel the ache
But I’m just selling something fake
I’d call you back, mean every word…
But I forget you once I’m heard</p>
<p>[Outro]
So take your screenshot, wear my tee
Believe in what you think is me
But when the stream ends, lights go dark…
You’re just another
Add to Cart</p>
<p>🎵 Title: “Just Business (I Love You)”</p>
<p>(Pop — bittersweet, catchy, emotionally complex)</p>
<p>[Verse 1]
Camera on, soft light hits
Fake lashes, truth that never fits
You’re back again, right on the dot
Another night, another shot</p>
<p>I smile the way he said I should
My boyfriend swears it&rsquo;s understood
“Say their name, then tilt your head
They’ll stay if you just play pretend”</p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus]
And I can see you through the screen
Your room’s a mess, you look unseen
But darling, I’m not really here
Just pixels feeding what you fear</p>
<p>[Chorus]
“I love you,” I say like a song
You hold on, even knowing it’s wrong
But fake love never quenches thirst
You want it real? Then pay me first
You keep me like your favorite vice
Junk food love, no real life spice
I’d say your name, make it feel true&hellip;
But I don’t know you — do you?</p>
<p>[Verse 2]
You bought the hoodie, clicked the bell
Signed up just to wish me well
But every kiss I send online
Is priced and placed by design</p>
<p>I sell the tears, the subtle sigh
My boyfriend helps me pick the lie
You need a girl who makes you feel
But I just sell what isn’t real</p>
<p>[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe deep down, you confess
This love’s a dress — it won’t undress
You scroll through dreams you can’t achieve
But still, you want a reason to believe</p>
<p>[Chorus]
“I love you,” I whisper again
Your only touch through touchscreen pain
But this connection’s just rehearsed
You want the truth? Then pay me first
You eat me like a candy treat
It’s sweet, but leaves you incomplete
I’d hold your hand, if this were real&hellip;
But I’m a product you can’t feel</p>
<p>[Bridge] (spoken/sung)
You tell yourself you know the game
But still, you whisper out my name
The real world shuts its door too loud
So here I am — soft, fake, and proud</p>
<p>I keep you warm, behind the glass
While every real chance slowly passed
You knew I’d never see your face
But stayed, because I filled the space</p>
<p>[Final Chorus]
“I love you,” I say one more time
A line I’ve sold in every rhyme
But baby, fake can’t cure the worst
You want my heart? Then pay me first
You crave me like a late-night snack
But I won’t love you back-to-back
I’d learn your name, if I could care…
But this is merch — not love — I wear</p>
<p>[Outro]
It’s just business, always was
You fell for silence wrapped in applause
And while you ache where hearts should be…
I’m livestreaming
your fantasy</p>
