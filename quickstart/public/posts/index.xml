      <description>I found inner piece.
What has happened? What have you done? Have you left your technology behind, moved to a cabin and started life of a hermit?
No not at all.
I still watch youtube, I still use social media via reddit or hacker news.
I am just at peace with it.
It is surprising since many things appear to crumble. At least on media the go through Jeffrey Epstein pefophile stuff, and go through all his connections.</description>

      <description>many of channels that are most subscribed to are a waste of time. They are targetted to kids, low quality, or click baity (like nastya, alan&amp;rsquo;s universe, toys and colors, luccas toon)
many of channels are targeted to kids, which makes me depressed. That is how kids are being raisied today
channels from india have viewership and subscribe counts that often dwarfs &amp;lsquo;western&amp;rsquo; videos. I know that there are many people in india, but maaaaan&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>The problem with technlogy future Technology is becoming one of the fundamental problems of the future. It is no longer just a tool but a means of spreading influence and control. This is why companies have embraced SaaS and subscription-based models — they allow them to maintain continuous control over their users.
In an environment dominated by technology, you are merely a cog in the machine.
The entire system has become hive-oriented.</description>

      <description>For years, Windows was the go-to &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; operating system. Plug something in, run an installer, play your game—simple. Meanwhile, Linux was for the patient and tech-savvy, often requiring manual configs and command-line tinkering.
But somewhere along the way, things changed.
Windows: Familiar, But Fragmented After a fresh Windows install, I tried launching an old game. It failed—missing Visual C++ Redistributable 2010. Finding the right version meant digging through sketchy download sites and dodging ad-ridden content farms.</description>

      <description>So I have seen two things happen:
UK pushes for digital ID, to be used Google requires government ID for any app to be used on certified Android device My Reddit response for the latter situation:
&amp;#34;The system&amp;#34; will eventually create a clear, visible divide between digital spaces: one for compliant citizens, and another for digital nomads, pirates, and freedom-seekers. This will lead to a dual existence, Mr. Anderson - one life under a digital ID, where you&amp;#39;re a law-abiding citizen in a controlled, sanitized environment… and another life in freer, unregulated spaces, where censorship is minimal and you can install and say what you want - but at your own risk.</description>

      <title>Hatespeech</title>

      <description>I have learned something today.
There are so many efforts to ban hate speech. It was all due to hate towards LGTB communities, and minorities.
I see currently how on Reddit everybody hates on dead republican Charlie Kirk.
So much for hatespeech online. Only certain &amp;lsquo;casts&amp;rsquo; of people are protected. The desired outcome by ruling class is protected.</description>

      <description>Recently, something strange—and honestly a bit disheartening—happened to me. I was banned from the r/technology subreddit on Reddit. At first, I had no idea why. I hadn’t broken any obvious rules, hadn’t flamed anyone, or posted anything off-topic. I was just sharing my own open-source project and hobby repository, something I thought would be of genuine interest to others.
Shortly afterward, I received a notification from another subreddit, r/webscraping, stating that my actions appeared &amp;ldquo;suspicious.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I was thinking about writing a book - something speculative, perhaps dystopian. The book was going to be about AI, and it would summarize many emerging trends I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing.
The world In this imagined future, the world is powered by five massive nuclear reactors - each one serving a continent. These are the &amp;ldquo;Big Hearts,&amp;rdquo; the energy cores of humanity. They are nearly indestructible.
Outside the mega-cities, nature reclaims the land.</description>

      <description>05:30 AM. You wake up feeling groggy. The alarm buzzes insistently. You groan and sit up, rubbing your eyes.
You mumble: &amp;ldquo;Wolly, anything important happen overnight?&amp;rdquo;
A soft glow pulses above your phone, and Wolly materializes — your AI assistant, slightly pixelated this early.
Wolly: &amp;ldquo;Plenty happened. But maybe start with a coffee first.&amp;rdquo;
You shuffle to the kitchen, start the machine, and lean against the counter as the coffee brews.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t hate Google. I disliked it for its Monopolistic behavior, for disdain for users.
Now I hate it.
I tried to read IMAP messages from Gmail to my own project. I had some problems in doing so.
I also found Gmail to SQLite program, which was doing mostly what I wanted, but also provided a clear instructions for Installation. It said that I need Gmail OAuth credentials, and provided description how to set them up.</description>

      <description>I already wrote that I hate &amp;ldquo;The algorithm&amp;rdquo;, which big tech is using to spoon feed you informarmation.
The most, I hate that they treat you like a baby, make you passive, where you should &amp;lsquo;hunt for information&amp;rsquo;.
Recently I had to stop using reddit, because they started serving me girls. They showed me more and more pictures of women. Yes, they were pretty, but I am not using reddit to watch content like that.</description>

      <description>My plan is to provide RSS reader / Internet command center.
My plan is to keep providing bookmarks:
music I like bookmarks books I like movies I like all domains database, with votes, and tags I shall continue creating lists &amp;ldquo;awesome lists&amp;rdquo;. There should be something like awesome list editor, that is capable of checking link consistency.
Problems:
I do not have yet books / movies database I am not sure towards which things I should point in books, or movies (imdb?</description>

      <title>AI slop does not affect me</title>

      <description>Today, I had an epiphany: I might not be as affected by AI-generated slop in search results as others.
I don’t rely much on algorithms. Doomscrolling is often filled with recommendations, ads, and AI-generated junk—but I don’t engage with it much.
By following RSS feeds, I get content directly from creators—no AI interference. And since I don’t depend on search as much, I avoid the problem altogether.
YouTube search is especially tragic, so having channels defined in a reader is so so much better experience.</description>

      <description>For a long period of time I have been working on an RSS client. This was a difficult task, and requiring a lot of effort in a long period of time.
Recently I have started making public some data. I wanted users to be able to see the output of my data.
There were problems:
My server would freeze intermittently. I could not serve many people since my server is running on a raspberry pi I didn’t want to deal with maintaining a VPS, configuring it, and handling all the associated overhead.</description>

      <title>If you don&#39;t do politics, politics will do you</title>

      <description>Why I Disagree with the Saying: &amp;ldquo;If You&amp;rsquo;re Not Interested in Politics, Politics Will Still Affect You&amp;rdquo;
I don’t like this saying, and here’s why:
It&amp;rsquo;s False. Lets reverse the logic. What happens if you are interested in Politics. It affects you. What happens if you are not interested in Politics? It affects you. So no matter what you do the Politics affects you. The statements create illusion that your interest makes a difference Interest in Politics is Not a Necessity.</description>

      <description>Recently, due to changes in Mozilla’s Terms of Service (TOS), I decided to switch browsers.
I thought that the transition would be simple and uneventful. I was wrong.
I switched to Waterfox, and here are some of the differences I noticed:
Custom Search Engines: Waterfox allows me to add a custom search engine. This was a huge win for me because Mozilla has blocked this option. Why, Mozilla? Did Google pay you enough to make this feature inaccessible?</description>

      <description>I recently came across a Reddit comment about RSS clients that caught my attention.
Sadly the easy solutions aren&amp;#39;t open source and the self hosted ones don&amp;#39;t seem to be worth the hassle to set up At first, I was surprised—self-hosting has always felt trivial to me.
But is it really?
I am a programmer, I am comfortable with tech. What about people who have only smartphones and do not know what is a script?</description>

      <description>I don’t think we’re living in an idiocracy; rather, we’re in an infantocracy. Much of the forcefully imposed DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) discourse seems to arise from this cultural shift.
Many people today may reach adulthood physically, but they often lack maturity due to a lack of significant hardship. This absence of resilience leaves them fragile, narcissistic, entitled, and overly demanding—traits that earn them the term “snowflakes.”
These individuals bring these tendencies into the workforce, creating an environment prone to unnecessary drama.</description>

      <description>I recently listened to &amp;ldquo;We Are Living in an Idiocracy&amp;rdquo; by Asmongold TV. It resonated deeply with thoughts I’ve been having for a while, which is why I decided to share my perspective here.
That said, I believe the title is somewhat misleading. This isn’t just about idiocracy but rather the rise of what feels like a new kind of &amp;ldquo;cult&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;secular religion&amp;rdquo; within our society. As a religious person, I’ve noticed this pattern emerging repeatedly, and it has been on my mind for some time.</description>

      <description>For some time now, I’ve been exploring awesome lists.
If you’re not familiar with them, awesome lists are curated collections of resources, tools, libraries, tutorials, and other valuable content, typically centered around a specific topic or theme. They are usually created by developers or enthusiasts and hosted on GitHub, making them easily accessible and open for contributions.
Examples:
https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted What fascinates me is why such lists exist in the first place.</description>
