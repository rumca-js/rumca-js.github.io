        <p>Another amusing yet frustrating incident occurred recently.</p>
<p>I discovered a particularly nasty bug in my code - it froze the entire app after exactly 10 page refreshes. I was initially baffled and unsure where to start debugging.</p>
<p>I’m no Python expert, and my main safety net is a solid suite of unit tests. Clearly, I still have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>When you lack advanced debugging skills, you make do with what you have. I started by observing the logs:</p>
<ol>
<li>PostgreSQL logs</li>
<li>Apache logs</li>
<li>dmesg</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, dmesg revealed issues with the drive, which made me a bit uneasy. I could not replace the drive, so I decided to poke around more.</p>
<p>Next, I investigated my software dependencies. I’d recently upgraded several third-party packages, opting for newer versions. I wondered if that introduced a bug. However, this led to another roadblock: downgrading wasn’t straightforward since my requirements.txt file does not fully track all packages. I didn&rsquo;t know which packages to downgrade. Frustrating.</p>
<p>I then checked the app’s stability at a previous commit. I identified a version where everything was working smoothly, pulled the code, and ran it. Success! The app was stable. What now?</p>
<p>From there, I began the painstaking process of copy-pasting changes, line by line, to isolate the issue. Initially, I copied significant chunks of code, but the app froze again. This required many back-and forth copy and restart operations. Frustration mounted. Sigh. Coffee. Sigh. Repeat.</p>
<p>Finally, after considerable effort, I pinpointed the culprit. Ironically, it was a bug I had recently fixed. It was a simple typo in variable name. Fixing that bug caused the freeze—a bizarre and unexpected outcome. Why? The subsequent lines of code checked whether a grammar library (Spacy) was loaded. Since the earlier bug was resolved, these lines executed for the first time and caused the app to freeze.</p>
<p>So fixing a simple bug created a very nasty behavior. Sigh.</p>
<p>The solution was simple - ensure the library was loaded only once, and not call it from apache. After making that change, everything worked perfectly.</p>
<p>What a journey—debugging truly tests both patience and creativity!</p>
