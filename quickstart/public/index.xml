      <title>Self Hosting hurdles</title>

      <description>I recently came across a Reddit comment about RSS clients that caught my attention.
Sadly the easy solutions aren&amp;#39;t open source and the self hosted ones don&amp;#39;t seem to be worth the hassle to set up At first, I was surprised—self-hosting has always felt trivial to me.
But is it really?
I am a programmer, I am comfortable with tech. What about people who have only smartphones and do not know what is a script?</description>

      <description>It always starts with a bug.
Recently I had several problems:
my RSS feed server, that I wrote, started freezing my web crawler, lead to OS freeze This happened after major code refactor. I split my RSS feed reader into two projects, so naturally things blew up.
I have unit tests mind you, but unit tests do not cover 100% of code.
My functional manual testing also did not show anything outstanding.</description>

      <description>Why You Should Share Your Links
Sharing and organizing links is more important than you might think. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
Your Knowledge is Valuable: You&amp;rsquo;ve likely visited interesting places online. Even if they seem obvious to you, others might find them invaluable. For the Greater Good: By storing and sharing your links, you&amp;rsquo;re creating a resource that benefits not just you, but also others who might need that information. Avoid Closed Platforms: Storing your links on closed platforms limits their accessibility and portability.</description>

      <description>For years, Google stood at the pinnacle of the corporate world, recognized as one of the most valuable companies globally. Its dominance was built on the strength of its search engine, which became indispensable to anyone wanting to be seen or heard online. &amp;ldquo;Play nice with Google,&amp;rdquo; they said, and you would thrive.
In its early days, Google&amp;rsquo;s business model relied heavily on user-generated web pages to build and refine its search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Will the Internet exist in 20 years?</title>

      <description>The Illusion of Boundless Opportunity We often think of the Internet as a vast, limitless space—a digital world where anyone can carve out their own unique niche and &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; a piece of private digital land.
But nothing could be more misleading.
The Internet is often compared to Lake Baikal, the world&amp;rsquo;s deepest lake. And in some ways, this metaphor is apt: immense in theory, but with most of its life concentrated in a small portion.</description>

      <description>I’ve created a page with an extensive collection of links. I have many, many links.
I tried advertising it on reddit, with some limited positive feedback, and I am a little bit surprised.
Google is potemkin village. You will not find some these links using normal search, so why people are not interested?
Thoughts maybe my lists are garbage. Not everything is relevant or engaging. The UI could be intimidating or off-putting.</description>

      <title>Infantocracy</title>

      <description>I don’t think we’re living in an idiocracy; rather, we’re in an infantocracy. Much of the forcefully imposed DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) discourse seems to arise from this cultural shift.
Many people today may reach adulthood physically, but they often lack maturity due to a lack of significant hardship. This absence of resilience leaves them fragile, narcissistic, entitled, and overly demanding—traits that earn them the term “snowflakes.”
These individuals bring these tendencies into the workforce, creating an environment prone to unnecessary drama.</description>

      <title>Secular religion</title>

      <description>I recently listened to &amp;ldquo;We Are Living in an Idiocracy&amp;rdquo; by Asmongold TV. It resonated deeply with thoughts I’ve been having for a while, which is why I decided to share my perspective here.
That said, I believe the title is somewhat misleading. This isn’t just about idiocracy but rather the rise of what feels like a new kind of &amp;ldquo;cult&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;secular religion&amp;rdquo; within our society. As a religious person, I’ve noticed this pattern emerging repeatedly, and it has been on my mind for some time.</description>

      <description>There are many things wrong with the current web, I wanted to keep track of them.
You can disagree with some of them, but that may not indicate you are right.
your page does not provide valid meta fields. There is a lot of them. Title, description. There are og: fields, image thumbnails, og: publish date. There is also LD-JSON data, and other SEO keyword tags your page is not bot friendly.</description>

      <title>Awesome lists</title>

      <description>For some time now, I’ve been exploring awesome lists.
If you’re not familiar with them, awesome lists are curated collections of resources, tools, libraries, tutorials, and other valuable content, typically centered around a specific topic or theme. They are usually created by developers or enthusiasts and hosted on GitHub, making them easily accessible and open for contributions.
Examples:
https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted What fascinates me is why such lists exist in the first place.</description>

      <description>Another amusing yet frustrating incident occurred recently.
I discovered a particularly nasty bug in my code - it froze the entire app after exactly 10 page refreshes. I was initially baffled and unsure where to start debugging.
I’m no Python expert, and my main safety net is a solid suite of unit tests. Clearly, I still have a lot to learn.
When you lack advanced debugging skills, you make do with what you have.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time I got up and checked my webpage. It&amp;rsquo;s a habit of mine — checking, making sure everything is up and running. I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it for anyone else. Nobody uses my app instances; I’m the sole user. Yet, I&amp;rsquo;m devoted.
That day, I ran into a problem. A table in my database had a data error and became completely unreadable. I tried fixing it—several times. I sifted through pages of documentation and even enlisted ChatGPT for assistance.</description>
