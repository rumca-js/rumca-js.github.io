      <description>Some time ago, I was thinking about writing a book - something speculative, perhaps dystopian. The book was going to be about AI, and it would summarize many emerging trends I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing.
The world In this imagined future, the world is powered by five massive nuclear reactors - each one serving a continent. These are the &amp;ldquo;Big Hearts,&amp;rdquo; the energy cores of humanity. They are nearly indestructible.
Outside the mega-cities, nature reclaims the land.</description>

      <description>I like to think about the future — and often, my predictions turn out to be accurate, which makes me happy.
Lately, I’ve been reflecting on Texas’ new law requiring age verification for app stores. I believe this is just continuation of a broader trend that will only become more pronounced. Increasingly, platforms and websites will be legally required to collect more data from users — and it won’t stop at age verification.</description>

      <description>05:30 AM. You wake up feeling groggy. The alarm buzzes insistently. You groan and sit up, rubbing your eyes.
You mumble: &amp;ldquo;Wolly, anything important happen overnight?&amp;rdquo;
A soft glow pulses above your phone, and Wolly materializes — your AI assistant, slightly pixelated this early.
Wolly: &amp;ldquo;Plenty happened. But maybe start with a coffee first.&amp;rdquo;
You shuffle to the kitchen, start the machine, and lean against the counter as the coffee brews.</description>

      <title>I hate Google</title>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t hate Google. I disliked it for its Monopolistic behavior, for disdain for users.
Now I hate it.
I tried to read IMAP messages from Gmail to my own project. I had some problems in doing so.
I also found Gmail to SQLite program, which was doing mostly what I wanted, but also provided a clear instructions for Installation. It said that I need Gmail OAuth credentials, and provided description how to set them up.</description>

      <description>I already wrote that I hate &amp;ldquo;The algorithm&amp;rdquo;, which big tech is using to spoon feed you informarmation.
The most, I hate that they treat you like a baby, make you passive, where you should &amp;lsquo;hunt for information&amp;rsquo;.
Recently I had to stop using reddit, because they started serving me girls. They showed me more and more pictures of women. Yes, they were pretty, but I am not using reddit to watch content like that.</description>

      <description>My plan is to provide RSS reader / Internet command center.
My plan is to keep providing bookmarks:
music I like bookmarks books I like movies I like all domains database, with votes, and tags I shall continue creating lists &amp;ldquo;awesome lists&amp;rdquo;. There should be something like awesome list editor, that is capable of checking link consistency.
Problems:
I do not have yet books / movies database I am not sure towards which things I should point in books, or movies (imdb?</description>

      <description>So it happened. Finally. I finished the full internet offline search.
So what it is?
It&amp;rsquo;s an internet search tool, designed to find domains on the web. It’s offline, meaning all searches are performed directly on your device. it uses JavaScript heresy It utilizes SQLite to fetch data. Link: Internet search
There are other side projects, mind you:

      <title>AI slop does not affect me</title>

      <description>Today, I had an epiphany: I might not be as affected by AI-generated slop in search results as others.
I don’t rely much on algorithms. Doomscrolling is often filled with recommendations, ads, and AI-generated junk—but I don’t engage with it much.
By following RSS feeds, I get content directly from creators—no AI interference. And since I don’t depend on search as much, I avoid the problem altogether.
YouTube search is especially tragic, so having channels defined in a reader is so so much better experience.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I stumbled upon an obscure video that resonated deeply with thoughts I’ve been having for a while. One idea in particular stood out:
&amp;ldquo;Creators create videos for the algorithm, not for the users&amp;rdquo;.
I had never thought about it that way before.
The video in question State of The Dead Internet explores the current state of the Internet and how it has changed. Some key takeaways:
The Internet feels increasingly empty and artificial.</description>

      <description>For a long period of time I have been working on an RSS client. This was a difficult task, and requiring a lot of effort in a long period of time.
Recently I have started making public some data. I wanted users to be able to see the output of my data.
There were problems:
My server would freeze intermittently. I could not serve many people since my server is running on a raspberry pi I didn’t want to deal with maintaining a VPS, configuring it, and handling all the associated overhead.</description>

      <description>Why I Disagree with the Saying: &amp;ldquo;If You&amp;rsquo;re Not Interested in Politics, Politics Will Still Affect You&amp;rdquo;
I don’t like this saying, and here’s why:
It&amp;rsquo;s False. Lets reverse the logic. What happens if you are interested in Politics. It affects you. What happens if you are not interested in Politics? It affects you. So no matter what you do the Politics affects you. The statements create illusion that your interest makes a difference Interest in Politics is Not a Necessity.</description>

      <title>Why I Switched to Waterfox and What I’ve Learned</title>

      <description>Recently, due to changes in Mozilla’s Terms of Service (TOS), I decided to switch browsers.
I thought that the transition would be simple and uneventful. I was wrong.
I switched to Waterfox, and here are some of the differences I noticed:
Custom Search Engines: Waterfox allows me to add a custom search engine. This was a huge win for me because Mozilla has blocked this option. Why, Mozilla? Did Google pay you enough to make this feature inaccessible?</description>

      <description>Let’s run an experiment.
Start tracking the sites you visit manually. Where have you been today? This month?
Most likely, your browsing habits follow a predictable pattern:
You watch a YouTube video, maybe checking your favorite channels. Or perhaps you don’t even have subscriptions—you just watch whatever &amp;ldquo;the algorithm&amp;rdquo; serves up. You check what&amp;rsquo;s new on Reddit or Rumble to stay updated. Occasionally, you visit mainstream news sites like BBC, CNN, or a tech blog.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a Reddit comment about RSS clients that caught my attention.
Sadly the easy solutions aren&amp;#39;t open source and the self hosted ones don&amp;#39;t seem to be worth the hassle to set up At first, I was surprised—self-hosting has always felt trivial to me.
But is it really?
I am a programmer, I am comfortable with tech. What about people who have only smartphones and do not know what is a script?</description>

      <description>It always starts with a bug.
Recently I had several problems:
my RSS feed server, that I wrote, started freezing my web crawler, lead to OS freeze This happened after major code refactor. I split my RSS feed reader into two projects, so naturally things blew up.
I have unit tests mind you, but unit tests do not cover 100% of code.
My functional manual testing also did not show anything outstanding.</description>

      <description>Why You Should Share Your Links
Sharing and organizing links is more important than you might think. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
Your Knowledge is Valuable: You&amp;rsquo;ve likely visited interesting places online. Even if they seem obvious to you, others might find them invaluable. For the Greater Good: By storing and sharing your links, you&amp;rsquo;re creating a resource that benefits not just you, but also others who might need that information. Avoid Closed Platforms: Storing your links on closed platforms limits their accessibility and portability.</description>

      <description>For years, Google stood at the pinnacle of the corporate world, recognized as one of the most valuable companies globally. Its dominance was built on the strength of its search engine, which became indispensable to anyone wanting to be seen or heard online. &amp;ldquo;Play nice with Google,&amp;rdquo; they said, and you would thrive.
In its early days, Google&amp;rsquo;s business model relied heavily on user-generated web pages to build and refine its search algorithms.</description>

      <description>The Illusion of Boundless Opportunity We often think of the Internet as a vast, limitless space—a digital world where anyone can carve out their own unique niche and &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; a piece of private digital land.
But nothing could be more misleading.
The Internet is often compared to Lake Baikal, the world&amp;rsquo;s deepest lake. And in some ways, this metaphor is apt: immense in theory, but with most of its life concentrated in a small portion.</description>

      <description>I’ve created a page with an extensive collection of links. I have many, many links.
I tried advertising it on reddit, with some limited positive feedback, and I am a little bit surprised.
Google is potemkin village. You will not find some these links using normal search, so why people are not interested?
Thoughts maybe my lists are garbage. Not everything is relevant or engaging. The UI could be intimidating or off-putting.</description>

      <description>I don’t think we’re living in an idiocracy; rather, we’re in an infantocracy. Much of the forcefully imposed DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) discourse seems to arise from this cultural shift.
Many people today may reach adulthood physically, but they often lack maturity due to a lack of significant hardship. This absence of resilience leaves them fragile, narcissistic, entitled, and overly demanding—traits that earn them the term “snowflakes.”
These individuals bring these tendencies into the workforce, creating an environment prone to unnecessary drama.</description>

      <description>I recently listened to &amp;ldquo;We Are Living in an Idiocracy&amp;rdquo; by Asmongold TV. It resonated deeply with thoughts I’ve been having for a while, which is why I decided to share my perspective here.
That said, I believe the title is somewhat misleading. This isn’t just about idiocracy but rather the rise of what feels like a new kind of &amp;ldquo;cult&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;secular religion&amp;rdquo; within our society. As a religious person, I’ve noticed this pattern emerging repeatedly, and it has been on my mind for some time.</description>

      <description>There are many things wrong with the current web, I wanted to keep track of them.
You can disagree with some of them, but that may not indicate you are right.
your page does not provide valid meta fields. There is a lot of them. Title, description. There are og: fields, image thumbnails, og: publish date. There is also LD-JSON data, and other SEO keyword tags your page is not bot friendly.</description>

      <description>For some time now, I’ve been exploring awesome lists.
If you’re not familiar with them, awesome lists are curated collections of resources, tools, libraries, tutorials, and other valuable content, typically centered around a specific topic or theme. They are usually created by developers or enthusiasts and hosted on GitHub, making them easily accessible and open for contributions.
Examples:
https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted What fascinates me is why such lists exist in the first place.</description>

      <description>Another amusing yet frustrating incident occurred recently.
I discovered a particularly nasty bug in my code - it froze the entire app after exactly 10 page refreshes. I was initially baffled and unsure where to start debugging.
I’m no Python expert, and my main safety net is a solid suite of unit tests. Clearly, I still have a lot to learn.
When you lack advanced debugging skills, you make do with what you have.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time I got up and checked my webpage. It&amp;rsquo;s a habit of mine — checking, making sure everything is up and running. I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it for anyone else. Nobody uses my app instances; I’m the sole user. Yet, I&amp;rsquo;m devoted.
That day, I ran into a problem. A table in my database had a data error and became completely unreadable. I tried fixing it—several times. I sifted through pages of documentation and even enlisted ChatGPT for assistance.</description>
