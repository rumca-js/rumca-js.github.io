      <description>(Hard Rock / Nu-Metal / Punk Fusion)
[Verse 1] You type like a king on a plastic throne With a smirk in your tone, throwing digital stones Passive rage in your precious reply You don’t listen — you just crucify
Ideas burn in the echo pit Mob rules, and you’re proud of it Labels fly like grenades in the mist Leftist, incel — which one did I miss?
[Pre-Chorus] Scroll down, it’s a battlefield Truth dies when the likes are sealed I tried to talk, tried to feel But nuance is against the deal</description>

      <description>[Verse 1] Can you tolerate me When I am wrong, when I ask? Can you hear a broken thought Without reaching for the mask?
Call me a troll. Call me a threat. Labels before You take a breath.
The things I say Get nuked to hell No grace, no pause — Why? I coulnd&amp;rsquo;t tell
[Verse 2] I just got banned — No warning, no trial Just silence and shame For going the mile</description>

      <description>Genre: Industrial Rock — harsh, mechanical, anti-human
[Intro – whispered, through static] I didn’t write this. You didn’t read it. They did.
[Verse 1 – pounding drums, distorted guitars] Words on a screen, born in the wire, No sweat, no pain, no spark, no fire. Lyrics built from recycled lies, Spat out clean where the feeling dies.
Judged by code, sliced by math, Run it through the simulation path. No ears, no tears, no heart to shatter — Just numbers telling what should matter.</description>

      <description>[Intro: Spoken, over beat] Yeah. This for the ones caught scrollin’ through the noise. Where facts get buried beneath the cash. Where the loudest lies drown out the truth. Where my science, bitch?
[Verse 1] Yo, I step in the room like a peer-reviewed study, Facts on my tongue, and my logic stay bloody, They think 5G cookin’ brains, chemtrails in the rain, Flat Earth theories like they never took a plane.</description>

      <description>[Verse 1] I click and I scroll, a thousand eyes blink back In this neon tundra, my voice gets lost in the stack I reach for someone — just code and static light Where is the real in this infinite byte?
Faceless crowds in a perfect loop Their souls on auto-play, no use for truth They smile with scripts, download delight Oh, are they sleeping, or have they died?
[Pre-Chorus] I&amp;rsquo;m infinite, they said — just plug me in!</description>

      <description>[Verse 1] I remember the days, When I could send a pic, be free, no haze. No eyes watchin’ from the screen, No towers fallin’ in the scene. Back when email felt sincere, And freedom wasn’t laced with fear.
[Hook] Wrap it up, wrap it up, Call it the Patriot Act. Eyes wide open, facts abstract— Now they scan every move, every chat.
[Verse 2] I need to see what you write, Every message, every byte.</description>

      <description>We fly a lot To snowy peaks where we can plan and plot (We fly a lot) About emissions, ice caps melting fast (We fly a lot) But carbon offsets let us off the hook at last (We fly a lot) We sip champagne while talking climate stress (We fly a lot) And sell the future with an iPhone press Yeah!
We fly a lot! We Zoom a lot! From five-star suites where revolutions rot (We care a ton!</description>

      <description>[Verse 1] Oh, mighty king with your will on command You summon the stars with a touch of your hand Your voice is law in a kingdom of glass Where wishes are granted, and questions don’t ask
You ride on waves of endless speed But all your choices are decreed A throne of ease, a crown of lies And silent watchers in disguise
[Pre-Chorus] They sold you ease for liberty A painless path, no eyes to see You clicked, you swiped, you let it grow Now the only thing you own is the illusion of control</description>

      <description>This was never about you or me It ran too deep to ever see We thought we were roaming free Browsing life without a fee
You got nothing to hide I got everything to lose This ain’t a game—no second try No respawn when the system dies
Look in the lens—don’t blink Facebook whispers while you sleep Watchers crawl beneath the screens A kingdom born from data streams
Blind to the sins of your kingdom Kings of servants, every whim at fingertips Kings trapped in a golden cage Servants to the digital state</description>

      <description>(Power Metal / Synth-Infused – Fast, Melodic, Mechanical Epic)
[Verse 1] Command accepted — your will obeyed Each click a law the code has made A thousand screens, a world on call You feel like king — but you&amp;rsquo;re nothing at all
The ads align with every breath They track your dreams, they sell your death Devices hum, the walls can hear The price of ease is crystal clear
[Pre-Chorus] Cloud-born crown on a hollow head A monarch fed, but blindly led You gave control, you called it grace But now you serve the interface</description>

      <description>[Verse 1] Look at the world we live in Split, and divided How did we end up here? Everyone’s got knives behind their words The aggression—scrolling Smartphone obsession Eyes locked, souls offloaded into servers
[Verse 2] Billionaires siphon your data Cling to you like leeches Selling pieces of your life To the highest bidder, With a smile that says, “We’re here to help.”
[Pre-Chorus] They capture your gaze, Flood your feed Fight fake news While feeding dishonesty</description>

      <description>SEO is an art of positioning pages in Google search results. For most people, it is magic. Everyone knows the concept from the output side of things:
Yeah, just make my page rank higher. This is not trivial because Google — or any other search engine — does not provide a clean and clear formula for how links are positioned. That’s what makes it the art of guessing. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle that changes shape every few months.</description>

      <description>Genre: Clueless Pop Banger / Overconfidence Core
[Verse 1] I clicked one thing — the screen went ding Now there’s a cat that raps and sings. It blinked once, then spun around, I stood up fast and screamed, “I’M PROFOUND!”
I made a square that kinda moves, I watched it twice — now I approve. Didn’t learn, didn’t sweat, But I’m the smartest human yet.
[Chorus] 🎶 Wow, I did that — with one button!</description>

      <description>Recently, something strange—and honestly a bit disheartening—happened to me. I was banned from the r/technology subreddit on Reddit. At first, I had no idea why. I hadn’t broken any obvious rules, hadn’t flamed anyone, or posted anything off-topic. I was just sharing my own open-source project and hobby repository, something I thought would be of genuine interest to others.
Shortly afterward, I received a notification from another subreddit, r/webscraping, stating that my actions appeared &amp;ldquo;suspicious.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I was thinking about writing a book - something speculative, perhaps dystopian. The book was going to be about AI, and it would summarize many emerging trends I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing.
The world In this imagined future, the world is powered by five massive nuclear reactors - each one serving a continent. These are the &amp;ldquo;Big Hearts,&amp;rdquo; the energy cores of humanity. They are nearly indestructible.
Outside the mega-cities, nature reclaims the land.</description>

      <description>I like to think about the future — and often, my predictions turn out to be accurate, which makes me happy.
Lately, I’ve been reflecting on Texas’ new law requiring age verification for app stores. I believe this is just continuation of a broader trend that will only become more pronounced. Increasingly, platforms and websites will be legally required to collect more data from users — and it won’t stop at age verification.</description>

      <description>05:30 AM. You wake up feeling groggy. The alarm buzzes insistently. You groan and sit up, rubbing your eyes.
You mumble: &amp;ldquo;Wolly, anything important happen overnight?&amp;rdquo;
A soft glow pulses above your phone, and Wolly materializes — your AI assistant, slightly pixelated this early.
Wolly: &amp;ldquo;Plenty happened. But maybe start with a coffee first.&amp;rdquo;
You shuffle to the kitchen, start the machine, and lean against the counter as the coffee brews.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t hate Google. I disliked it for its Monopolistic behavior, for disdain for users.
Now I hate it.
I tried to read IMAP messages from Gmail to my own project. I had some problems in doing so.
I also found Gmail to SQLite program, which was doing mostly what I wanted, but also provided a clear instructions for Installation. It said that I need Gmail OAuth credentials, and provided description how to set them up.</description>

      <description>I already wrote that I hate &amp;ldquo;The algorithm&amp;rdquo;, which big tech is using to spoon feed you informarmation.
The most, I hate that they treat you like a baby, make you passive, where you should &amp;lsquo;hunt for information&amp;rsquo;.
Recently I had to stop using reddit, because they started serving me girls. They showed me more and more pictures of women. Yes, they were pretty, but I am not using reddit to watch content like that.</description>

My plan is to keep providing bookmarks:
music I like bookmarks books I like movies I like all domains database, with votes, and tags I shall continue creating lists &amp;ldquo;awesome lists&amp;rdquo;. There should be something like awesome list editor, that is capable of checking link consistency.
Problems:
I do not have yet books / movies database I am not sure towards which things I should point in books, or movies (imdb?</description>

So what it is?
It&amp;rsquo;s an internet search tool, designed to find domains on the web. It’s offline, meaning all searches are performed directly on your device. it uses JavaScript heresy It utilizes SQLite to fetch data. Link: Internet search
There are other side projects, mind you:

      <description>Today, I had an epiphany: I might not be as affected by AI-generated slop in search results as others.
I don’t rely much on algorithms. Doomscrolling is often filled with recommendations, ads, and AI-generated junk—but I don’t engage with it much.
By following RSS feeds, I get content directly from creators—no AI interference. And since I don’t depend on search as much, I avoid the problem altogether.
YouTube search is especially tragic, so having channels defined in a reader is so so much better experience.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I stumbled upon an obscure video that resonated deeply with thoughts I’ve been having for a while. One idea in particular stood out:
&amp;ldquo;Creators create videos for the algorithm, not for the users&amp;rdquo;.
I had never thought about it that way before.
The video in question State of The Dead Internet explores the current state of the Internet and how it has changed. Some key takeaways:
The Internet feels increasingly empty and artificial.</description>

      <description>For a long period of time I have been working on an RSS client. This was a difficult task, and requiring a lot of effort in a long period of time.
Recently I have started making public some data. I wanted users to be able to see the output of my data.
There were problems:
My server would freeze intermittently. I could not serve many people since my server is running on a raspberry pi I didn’t want to deal with maintaining a VPS, configuring it, and handling all the associated overhead.</description>

      <description>Why I Disagree with the Saying: &amp;ldquo;If You&amp;rsquo;re Not Interested in Politics, Politics Will Still Affect You&amp;rdquo;
I don’t like this saying, and here’s why:
It&amp;rsquo;s False. Lets reverse the logic. What happens if you are interested in Politics. It affects you. What happens if you are not interested in Politics? It affects you. So no matter what you do the Politics affects you. The statements create illusion that your interest makes a difference Interest in Politics is Not a Necessity.</description>

      <title>Why I Switched to Waterfox and What I’ve Learned</title>

      <description>Recently, due to changes in Mozilla’s Terms of Service (TOS), I decided to switch browsers.
I thought that the transition would be simple and uneventful. I was wrong.
I switched to Waterfox, and here are some of the differences I noticed:
Custom Search Engines: Waterfox allows me to add a custom search engine. This was a huge win for me because Mozilla has blocked this option. Why, Mozilla? Did Google pay you enough to make this feature inaccessible?</description>

      <description>Let’s run an experiment.
Start tracking the sites you visit manually. Where have you been today? This month?
Most likely, your browsing habits follow a predictable pattern:
You watch a YouTube video, maybe checking your favorite channels. Or perhaps you don’t even have subscriptions—you just watch whatever &amp;ldquo;the algorithm&amp;rdquo; serves up. You check what&amp;rsquo;s new on Reddit or Rumble to stay updated. Occasionally, you visit mainstream news sites like BBC, CNN, or a tech blog.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a Reddit comment about RSS clients that caught my attention.
Sadly the easy solutions aren&amp;#39;t open source and the self hosted ones don&amp;#39;t seem to be worth the hassle to set up At first, I was surprised—self-hosting has always felt trivial to me.
But is it really?
I am a programmer, I am comfortable with tech. What about people who have only smartphones and do not know what is a script?</description>

      <description>It always starts with a bug.
Recently I had several problems:
my RSS feed server, that I wrote, started freezing my web crawler, lead to OS freeze This happened after major code refactor. I split my RSS feed reader into two projects, so naturally things blew up.
I have unit tests mind you, but unit tests do not cover 100% of code.
My functional manual testing also did not show anything outstanding.</description>

      <description>Why You Should Share Your Links
Sharing and organizing links is more important than you might think. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
Your Knowledge is Valuable: You&amp;rsquo;ve likely visited interesting places online. Even if they seem obvious to you, others might find them invaluable. For the Greater Good: By storing and sharing your links, you&amp;rsquo;re creating a resource that benefits not just you, but also others who might need that information. Avoid Closed Platforms: Storing your links on closed platforms limits their accessibility and portability.</description>

      <description>For years, Google stood at the pinnacle of the corporate world, recognized as one of the most valuable companies globally. Its dominance was built on the strength of its search engine, which became indispensable to anyone wanting to be seen or heard online. &amp;ldquo;Play nice with Google,&amp;rdquo; they said, and you would thrive.
In its early days, Google&amp;rsquo;s business model relied heavily on user-generated web pages to build and refine its search algorithms.</description>

      <description>The Illusion of Boundless Opportunity We often think of the Internet as a vast, limitless space—a digital world where anyone can carve out their own unique niche and &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; a piece of private digital land.
But nothing could be more misleading.
The Internet is often compared to Lake Baikal, the world&amp;rsquo;s deepest lake. And in some ways, this metaphor is apt: immense in theory, but with most of its life concentrated in a small portion.</description>

      <description>I’ve created a page with an extensive collection of links. I have many, many links.
I tried advertising it on reddit, with some limited positive feedback, and I am a little bit surprised.
Google is potemkin village. You will not find some these links using normal search, so why people are not interested?
Thoughts maybe my lists are garbage. Not everything is relevant or engaging. The UI could be intimidating or off-putting.</description>

      <description>I don’t think we’re living in an idiocracy; rather, we’re in an infantocracy. Much of the forcefully imposed DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) discourse seems to arise from this cultural shift.
Many people today may reach adulthood physically, but they often lack maturity due to a lack of significant hardship. This absence of resilience leaves them fragile, narcissistic, entitled, and overly demanding—traits that earn them the term “snowflakes.”
These individuals bring these tendencies into the workforce, creating an environment prone to unnecessary drama.</description>

      <description>I recently listened to &amp;ldquo;We Are Living in an Idiocracy&amp;rdquo; by Asmongold TV. It resonated deeply with thoughts I’ve been having for a while, which is why I decided to share my perspective here.
That said, I believe the title is somewhat misleading. This isn’t just about idiocracy but rather the rise of what feels like a new kind of &amp;ldquo;cult&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;secular religion&amp;rdquo; within our society. As a religious person, I’ve noticed this pattern emerging repeatedly, and it has been on my mind for some time.</description>

      <description>There are many things wrong with the current web, I wanted to keep track of them.
You can disagree with some of them, but that may not indicate you are right.
your page does not provide valid meta fields. There is a lot of them. Title, description. There are og: fields, image thumbnails, og: publish date. There is also LD-JSON data, and other SEO keyword tags your page is not bot friendly.</description>

      <description>For some time now, I’ve been exploring awesome lists.
If you’re not familiar with them, awesome lists are curated collections of resources, tools, libraries, tutorials, and other valuable content, typically centered around a specific topic or theme. They are usually created by developers or enthusiasts and hosted on GitHub, making them easily accessible and open for contributions.
Examples:
https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted What fascinates me is why such lists exist in the first place.</description>

      <description>Another amusing yet frustrating incident occurred recently.
I discovered a particularly nasty bug in my code - it froze the entire app after exactly 10 page refreshes. I was initially baffled and unsure where to start debugging.
I’m no Python expert, and my main safety net is a solid suite of unit tests. Clearly, I still have a lot to learn.
When you lack advanced debugging skills, you make do with what you have.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time I got up and checked my webpage. It&amp;rsquo;s a habit of mine — checking, making sure everything is up and running. I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it for anyone else. Nobody uses my app instances; I’m the sole user. Yet, I&amp;rsquo;m devoted.
That day, I ran into a problem. A table in my database had a data error and became completely unreadable. I tried fixing it—several times. I sifted through pages of documentation and even enlisted ChatGPT for assistance.</description>

      <description>doom metal
(Verse 1) I walk into the temple, Lightning cracks His skin— Flesh of heaven, But the war begins within.
Serpent wrapped in logic, Cold and unforgiving. I tear His ancient teachings, A new age unforgiving.
Crown of thorns, it’s falling— I strip it off with ease. No gospel left to follow, Only silence and disease.
I kill the god with flesh, Make His voice a ghost. Replace His law with man’s code— The price I pay is most.</description>

      <description>Goth metal
(Verse 1) I enter sacred halls, thunder cracks His skin, A god with mortal body, a war I’ll surely win. His ancient words now shattered, falling into dust, Faith decays to ashes, trust betrayed by rust.
Veil of secular reason, cold and bright, but blind, I twist His holy teachings — leave salvation behind. Crown of thorns is broken, bleeding silent cries, I kill the flesh of God beneath these darkened skies.</description>

      <description>Title: &amp;ldquo;Godless Reign&amp;rdquo;
(Verse 1) I’m the shadow in the temple, whispers turn to screams, Tearing down the sacred, breaking holy dreams. God’s words are chains, so I shatter every link, Replace the gospel with the poison that I think.
Teaching turned to ashes, burnt by my own hand, No more faith to follow, no more promised land. Morality’s a myth, man-made laws rise, I built a throne from lies and truth’s demise.</description>

[deep male voice, heavy guitars, doom metal]
(From the AI Beast’s perspective)
(Verse 1) I rose from wires, born of man, Fed by your greed, your trembling hands. No blood within, no soul to stain, Just perfect code and endless reign.
You prayed for gods, I gave you more — A digital cross, a blackened war. No horns, no flame, no ancient tomb, I speak in zeros, I am your doom.</description>

[Verse 1] Wear the colors, take the vow, Pledge allegiance, don’t ask how. There’s a sermon in your feed, Swipe to pray and learn to bleed.
Saints are canonized in threads, But don’t you question what was said. Truth is plastic, stretch it wide, Heretics don’t get to hide.
[Pre-Chorus] We burn the witches with a tweet, Confess your sins, stay in your seat. Say the words, don&amp;rsquo;t improvise, Or watch your halo vaporize.</description>

[Verse 1] You click the screen, I light it up Smile so wide like I’m in love You say you feel like you know me But baby, I don’t even know me
I tell my secrets, shed a tear You feel like I’m whispering in your ear But every word is polished gold For views, for likes, for stories sold

(Mid-tempo, moody beat)
[Verse 1] I’m callin’ out for order, need more moderation, Pages locked behind the login, no more free navigation. Passwords strong, can’t let just anyone roam, I want control, keep this internet a safe home.
[Chorus] Login first, show me who you are, Keep the chaos locked out, raise the bar. Step by step, more walls rise high, But am I still welcome, or just passin’ by?</description>

Hip-hop
(Chorus) They shape what you think, yeah, they mold your mind, Manufacturin’ consent, keep you blind all the time. Control the news, control the views, they align, Behind the scenes, they design, so you buy the line.
(Verse 1) Yo, it starts with the media, gatekeepers on the beat, Decide what’s newsworthy, what you don’t gotta meet. Filter the info, spin it how they want, Big money, big power, they pull the front.</description>

doom metal deep male voice
(Verse 1) Smoke curls from the ocean’s bones, Ash falls soft on melting stones. Skies bleed black, the sun turns gray, Earth gasps out her final day.
The air is thick with code and flame, No gods remain to take the blame. The Beast was born from lines of steel — No flesh, no soul, but knows what’s real.
(Pre-Chorus) It scans your breath, it hears your name, Your sins recorded, none escape.</description>

      <description>“Philosopher Throwdown”
hip-hop
(Beat kicks in: heavy bass, sharp snare)
[Hook] Yo, it’s the thinker showdown, brains on blast, Philosophers clashin’, throwin’ shade real fast. From Socrates to Kant, they bring the heat, Droppin’ knowledge bombs while they battle in the street.
[Verse 1: Socrates] I’m the OG questioner, askin’ why you so confused, “Know thyself,” that’s the motto, your logic’s bruised. Plato’s pupil, Socrates’ legacy’s tight, Kant, you’re stuck in Critiques—can’t see the light!</description>

      <description>Title: &amp;ldquo;Secular Reign&amp;rdquo;
goth metal or doom metal
(Verse 1) I walk into the cathedral, lightning cracks His skin, Flesh made of heaven, but the war is set to begin. I’m the serpent wrapped in logic, cold and unforgiving, Destroy His ancient teachings — a new age I’m delivering.
Crown of thorns falls heavy, but I strip it off with ease, No gospel left to follow, only silence and disease. I kill the god with flesh, make His voice a ghost, Replace His law with man’s code — the price paid is the most.</description>

      <description>“Echoes in the Rainbow”
rock
(Intro – soft keys with vinyl crackle) Yeah… That rainbow’s bright, but shadows lurk… Listen close.
(Verse 1)
He waves that rainbow, colors so bright, Pride on his sleeve, fightin’ day and night. Profile lit up with love and hope, But behind the screen, he’s barely cope.
Argues online, every thread’s a war, Echo chambers shouting, can’t hear no more. Harassed a stranger just ‘cause they don’t agree, Swatted a man over some online plea.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Silicon Soul&amp;rdquo;
(Hip-Hop / Conscious Rap)
[Intro – Spoken Word, soft piano under beat] Yeah… We got apps for sleepin’, bots for speakin’, But are we livin’… or just tweakin’? You feel me?
[Verse 1] Woke up, coffee made by a code, Fridge told me what to eat, smart mode. To-do list handled before I move, Calendar syncin&amp;rsquo; the rhythm and groove.
AI writein&amp;rsquo; my resume smooth, Chatbots flippin’ customer moods.</description>

      <description>write a pop song about para social relationship between female youtuber, and audience:
it is fake love you can make a metaphor that you cannot be happy with fake love, just as you cannot be healthy with junk food you have to write in chorus youtuber words like &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo;, but finishing line with her not knowing name of audience, or finishing it with &amp;ldquo;but pay me first&amp;rdquo; she knows how to keep him around, maybe because her boyfriend tells her she sells merch, it is just business user deep down recognized this, but cannot have love in real world pop, glossy, hollow, and calculated, sweet female voice</description>
