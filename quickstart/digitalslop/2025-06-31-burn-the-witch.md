write me a gothic metal song:
from perspecitve of someone who explains the witch how to world looks. it is metaphor for how mob destroys careers of people

 - the witch is burned
 - digital personas can be cancelled, when somebody is accused
 - judgment, without trial
 - include medieval imaginary: mob, pitchforks
 - using fake morality of kingdom (changes each day)
 - there are three witches. One agrees to be freed, one fights with false accuses, one does nothing, just burns
 one used facebook, one reddit, one youtube




🔥⚖️ Title: "The Day They Came With Fire" ⚖️🔥
By [Your Band Name]
(Genre: Gothic Metal / Doom / Darkwave fusion)

[Verse I]
I found you in the hollow, wrapped in midnight’s veil
Your eyes still blind to embers that the wind begins to sail
You asked me what this kingdom was, this land of shifting law
I told you: truth is slaughtered here, beneath the lion’s paw

[Verse II]
Some call it justice, some call it sin
But none recall the start of it, nor how it shall begin
The pitchforks rise like hungry wolves, in robes of virtue dressed
But they wear a different scripture scrawled across each beating chest

[Chorus]
The day they came with fire, they called you witch, they screamed your name
But guilt was not required, just one spark to light the flame
They feasted on your ashes like a rite they can’t explain
In the court of no tomorrow, we are all just masks and blame

[Verse III]
No judge, no trial, no gallows tree — just shadows on a screen
They cast your name in pixel blood, and call their daggers clean
Some are witches, some are not, but it matters not at all
When the mob is fed its theater, it only wants a fall

[Bridge] (slow, spoken over droning chords)
Today you are the heretic — tomorrow, their crowned saint
Their morals shift like weathered flags above a throne of paint
They do not burn you for your sin…
They burn you just because they can

[Chorus]
The day they came with fire, they sang of pride and holy cause
But every anthem hides a hand that sharpens social claws
Digital pyres blaze anew with every cry for “laws!”
In this kingdom, every echo carves its own unholy cross

[Outro] (building to crescendo)
So now you know, dear witch of flame, how fragile thrones are made
By breaking bones on comment stones and truth that’s left to fade
I told you how the world will turn — with grace, and with disgrace
They love to see a martyr burn
But never show their face...

(last line whispered)
Never show their face...




🔥⚖️ The Day They Came With Fire ⚖️🔥

Gothic Metal | 3 Witches Version

[Verse I – Narrator to the First Witch]
You, the clever one, you bowed your head,
Swore silence to escape the thread
You traded sparks for peace and skin,
And let the mob believe their sin.
Now you wear their crown of chains,
Alive, but echoing their stains.

[Verse II – Narrator to the Second Witch]
You stood alone with sharpened tongue,
Screamed justice while the bells were rung.
But no one listens when they feast,
Their hunger is the only priest.
Truth was lost before the flame —
They only wanted blood and name.

[Chorus]
The day they came with fire,
They had no need for proof or plea.
Just cries behind the choir,
And laws that change like tides at sea.
No verdict, only fury’s breath —
In this theater, pain is death.

[Verse III – Narrator to the Third Witch]
And you... the quiet one,
You never begged, you did not run.
You watched the sky grow red and high,
A silhouette against the lie.
No curse, no prayer, no final word,
Just silence louder than the herd.

[Bridge – Spoken / Growled, over slow dirge riff]
One was spared,
One was scarred,
One was scorched into the stars.
But none were heard, and none were seen —
Just whispers in the guillotine.

Their crime was not a deed or spell,
But standing where the righteous fell.

[Chorus II – Full Force]
The day they came with fire,
Their pitchforks crowned in fleeting grace
Each face a masked messiah
Each voice a judge without a face
Some are witches, some are not —
But that was never what they sought

[Outro – Soft, haunting]
So burn, dear witch, and light the sky
Show those who watch what truth must die
For kingdoms built on shifting lies
Will always need a flame to rise…

(last line whispered)
...and someone still to burn.



🕯️ "Thrones of Smoke"

Gothic Metal – By [Your Band Name]
Tempo: Slow to Mid-paced | Style: Dark, brooding, poetic
[Verse I – The Awakening]

You asked me why they stare like that —
With oil and ash behind their eyes.
Why every name they carve in fire
Is buried deep beneath their lies.

This kingdom feeds on rumor's breath,
Their law is rot, their truth is death.
Each day a new decree is born,
By morning’s grace, by evening torn.
[Chorus – The Fire Comes]

No gavel falls, no trial stands,
Just pitchfork hearts and trembling hands.
They crown you witch — you wear it blind —
Their justice shifts with every wind.

One scream, one post, one holy flood —
And you are swallowed in the blood.
For here, your soul’s a silhouette —
A target made of past regret.
[Verse II – The Three Witches]

There were three before you, bound in smoke:
Each with fate the mob invoked.

One dropped her wand and kissed the floor,
She swore she'd never spell once more.
They let her live — with hollow grace —
A shadow clinging to her face.

The second rose with wrath and scream,
Denied their tales, defied their scheme.
But truth is cursed when lies are fed —
They burned her just the same instead.

And one… just stared into the flame,
No plea, no fight, not even name.
She let the fire write her song —
The only one who proved them wrong.
[Bridge – Spoken / Growled]

They call it justice.
But it’s theater made of ash.
They say “protect the kingdom,”
While they rewrite the past.

Morality here wears a crown of dust —
And trades its robes for wrath and rust.
Each day they shift what’s holy, clean —
Each day they kill what they once deemed queen.
[Chorus – The Mob Returns]

No grave, no shrine, no martyr's bell,
Just hashtags carved where legends fell.
You bleed in silence, pixel-bound —
Your echo lost in hollow sound.

So burn, sweet witch, and know it’s true —
The curse was never cast by you.
The fire's not yours. It never was.
It’s theirs — their hunger, and their cause.
[Outro – The Final Lesson]

You asked me how the world will turn…
I said: it burns.
It burns.
It always burns.




🔥 "Kingdom of Smoke and Signal"

(From the perspective of a narrator explaining to a witch how the world works — blending medieval imagery and digital cancel culture as metaphors for mob justice)
[Intro – Whispered]

You thought the fire was ancient,
But it's streaming now in high-res pain.
You thought the pitchforks were buried,
But they scroll… and scroll again.
[Verse I – The Warning]

This is no kingdom of stone and crown,
But code and pulse where flames rain down.
Where words are trials and thoughts are crimes,
And silence breaks a thousand times.

They gather still with torches lit,
But now they swipe, accuse, commit.
Their gospel shifts from day to day —
Their halos rust, then fade away.
[Pre-Chorus]

No courtroom, no rite, no gavel falls,
Just echoes cast from comment halls.
And when they shout, it’s not for truth —
It’s just to feed the beast of youth.
[Chorus]

Burn, witch, burn — let your shadow be sold
In the kingdom of smoke and signal gold.
Three stood before, three bore the flame —
Each lit by mobs who screamed their name.
No trial, no sword — just shame and scroll,
This is how they cleanse the soul.
[Verse II – The Three Witches]

One spoke through Facebook, sweet and tame,
Posted spells with her full real name.
They offered her peace if she bowed her head,
She kissed their boots — they called her dead.

One raged on Reddit, cloaked in lore,
She dared to ask what truth was for.
They loved her fire, then called her vile —
And dragged her through the data pile.

One sang on YouTube, soft and low,
No lies, no fight — just quiet woe.
She didn’t run, she didn’t plead,
She only watched her channel bleed.
[Bridge – Spoken / Growled]

They call it justice.
But it’s theater.
A noose made out of numbers,
Hung from towers of fake honor.

Their morals bend like reeds in flood —
Today you're saint, tomorrow mud.
Their crowns are built on trending lies,
Their glory fades as someone dies.
[Chorus II – Darker Variation]

Burn, witch, burn — let the streamers cheer
While virtue veils their hate and fear.
They point with clicks, not rusted blades,
But still the fire never fades.
Three were tried, yet none were heard —
Just swallowed whole by spoken word.
[Outro – Soft and Cold]

So now you know the way it ends —
No justice, only consequence.
And in this land of truth betrayed,
The kind, the cruel, the still… all fade.

One fought.
One begged.
One never screamed.
All were real.
All were dreamed.




🎭 "The Kingdom That Never Forgives"

Gothic Metal Ballad – Dark, Slow to Mid-Tempo, Orchestral Elements, Dual Vocals (clean & growl)
[Verse I – The Explanation Begins]

You asked me why the sky turned red
Why songs are drowned, and words are dead
Why voices burn without a flame
Why no one dares to speak your name

I said: This kingdom feasts on fear
It builds its thrones from what you post and share
No sword, no chain, no iron bars —
Just torches lit from avatar stars
[Pre-Chorus – Whispered, Then Rising]

And judgment comes not cloaked in black
But draped in virtue they just unpack
It shifts its robes from day to night —
One rule for wrong, one more for right
[Chorus – Full Force]

Welcome to the kingdom that never forgives
Where the mob decides who dies, who lives
Three witches stood where you now fall —
They burned them all… they burned them all

No trial, no truth, just pitchfork praise
And shifting law that changes with the day
Say nothing wrong — or say it loud
The fire comes either way
[Verse II – The Tale of Three Witches]

The first one danced on YouTube's flame
She made them smile, she played their game
But one mistake — they pulled her strings
She said, “Yes, I’m a witch — unbind my wings”
They let her go, but took her song
Now she walks free… but doesn’t belong

The second roared from Reddit’s keep
With rage and fire she wouldn't sleep
She fought the lies with sword and spell —
They dragged her down, she fought too well
They crowned her queen of hate and shame
And set her ghost inside the flame

The third… she lived on Facebook’s stage
She simply watched the coming rage
She made no plea, she told no lie
She didn’t run, she didn’t cry
She let the fire have her name —
The only one who left unchanged
[Bridge – Spoken/Growled Over Heavy Drones]

Three paths, three fates — none are spared
Confess, resist, or just be there
They call it justice, call it clean
But it’s a ritual, cruel, unseen

The kingdom wears a crown of smoke
It hides behind the words it broke
Their morals twist, their banners fade
Their heroes shift from flame to blade
[Chorus – With Orchestral Layers]

Welcome to the kingdom that never forgives
Where the saints are burned and the villain lives
Three witches gone, and none were wrong —
But mobs don’t care who sings the song

No judge, no jury, just a screen
And silence louder than the scream
Say nothing, scream, or bend and bow —
It doesn't matter now
[Outro – Clean Vocals, Minimal Instrumentation]

So now, dear witch, you understand —
This world won’t care who takes a stand
It doesn't seek the truth or crime…
It only needs a match and time

And when they come, don't ask them why —
They’ll just say: “Witches always lie.”



write me a gothic metal song:
from perspecitve of mob leader why they burn the witch.
 - it is metaphor of being canceled on internet

 - first witch, blaimed by being immoral. leading people into abyss. she disagreed, mob decided to burn
 - second witch, blamed for siding with false prophet. No proof, but someone accused her. she agreed, was banished, set free
 - the third witch was not liked. she was real witch. died in silence at first, then burst into laugh
 - digital personas can be cancelled, when somebody is accused
 - judgment, without trial
 - include medieval imaginary: mob, pitchforks
 - there are three witches. One agrees to be freed, one fights with false accuses, one does nothing, just burns
 one used facebook, one reddit, one youtube


🎵 Three Witches Burn
(Gothic Metal — Mid-tempo, Dark, Heavy with Choral Backing)

[Verse I – The First Witch: The Heretic of the Feed]

They found her dancing by the black-glass flame,
With words too sharp, and thoughts unchained.
They said she lured the youth to fall,
Beyond the gate, beyond the wall.

She spoke of truth in ancient tongues,
We heard her posts, they bit like bats.
She claimed the mob was drunk with fear —
So we made the judgment loud and clear.
[Chorus]

🔥 Three witches burn beneath the moon,
The pitchforks rise, they chant in tune.
No trial, no proof, no sacred bell,
We are the judges, we cast the spell.
Ash to ash, screen to screen —
We purge the ones who dare be seen.
[Verse II – The Second Witch: The Prophet’s Friend]

A whisper came, she stood too near
The one they call the seer of fear.
No post remained, just echoes red —
But someone said what someone said.

She didn’t fight, she bowed her head,
And so we spared her from the dead.
Let her drift in exile’s breeze,
Unfollowed, blocked, her sentence: peace.

[Bridge: Digital Torches]

Raise your phones like blades of fire,
Scroll the gallows, feed the pyre.
In the square where justice dies,
The mob decides what truth implies.

Facebook fed the first one's flame,
Reddit cast the second's shame.
YouTube watched the third one die —
But none recall her final cry.

[Verse III – The Third Witch: The Silent Flame]

She never spoke, she never ran,
She watched the torches, then began
To burn in silence, wrapped in smoke —
Her lips were closed until she broke.

Then from the ash, a laugh did rise —
Not tears, but thunder from the skies.
She knew the game, she played no part,
And died with iron in her heart.

[Chorus – Reprise]

🔥 Three witches burn beneath the moon,
The pitchforks rise, they chant in tune.
No trial, no proof, no sacred bell,
We are the judges, we cast the spell.
Ash to ash, name to name —
A thousand voices, one to blame.

[Outro – Mob Leader’s Reflection]

Now I lead, the flames obey,
But in the mirror, I decay.
I lit the fire, I fed the spark —
But every witch leaves her mark.

We scroll, we burn, we never learn —
And still... the witches burn.
