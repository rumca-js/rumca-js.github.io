write a cyberpunk song about cyber city:
 - girls selling dreams on streets fighting for your attention
 - hackers attacking people in a district
 - you can find happines or death in chorus
 - you can find what you crave for
 - there is a place to play, to learn, to spent time

ðŸŽµ Neon Crave ðŸŽµ
(Genre: Dark Synthwave / Cyberpunk Rock)

[Verse 1]
Midnight flickers on a broken screen,
City's pulse in electric green.
Girls sell dreams down on Circuit Street,
Heels like daggers, fire in their speech.
They fight for glances, they dance through smoke,
Chasing hearts with words they broke.

[Pre-Chorus]
Neon shadows whisper lies,
Hope and hunger in disguise.
Where data flows and morals die,
Youâ€™ll find the truth... or learn to lie.

[Chorus]
Welcome to the city where the lines all blur,
Where you can find what you crave forâ€”
Love or rage, code or war.
Happiness or death behind every door.
A place to play, to learn, to bleed,
Cyber City feeds your need.

[Verse 2]
Hackers strike in Sector Three,
Firewalls burn in silent screams.
They donâ€™t want gold, they want your face,
Your soul's on sale in a data chase.
In this maze, trust is a glitch,
One wrong turn and youâ€™re flipped that switch.

[Pre-Chorus]
Neon lights and broken trust,
Steel and wires turned to dust.
It's not survivalâ€”it's a game,
And everyone here plays for fame.

[Chorus]
Welcome to the city where the lines all blur,
Where you can find what you crave forâ€”
Love or rage, code or war.
Happiness or death behind every door.
A place to play, to learn, to bleed,
Cyber City feeds your need.

[Bridge]
Upload your soul, download your sin,
Every ending can begin again.
Chips in veins and hearts on hold,
In Cyber City, even gods get sold.

[Final Chorus]
Welcome to the city where the lines all blur,
Where you can find what you crave forâ€”
Dreams or drugs, peace or gore.
Happiness or death behind every door.
A place to burn, to rise, to feed,
Cyber City knows your need...

[Outro]
Crave in neon, drown in sound,
Lose yourself where lost souls are found.
