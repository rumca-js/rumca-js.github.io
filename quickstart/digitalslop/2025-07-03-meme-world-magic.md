write a pop song:
 - glorifies memes
 - makes society more peacful
 - people sip tea when watching as babies do stuff
 - cat videos are showed by wife to husband
 - it is the only bastion of free speech
 - makes people smile
 - can change your day
 - can change you attitude
 - somehow you smile to strangers


"Meme World Magic"

[Verse 1]
Scrolling through my phone, a world so bright,
Memes hit my head, everything’s alright,
Laughter’s loud, and the vibes are free,
In this digital sea, it’s the place to be.

[Pre-Chorus]
No rules, no walls, just pure delight,
A pixel playground shining through the night,
From cats in hats to babies who coo,
Memes bring the sunshine right to you.

[Chorus]
Meme world magic, the only free speech,
Where smiles grow bigger with every reach,
It can make your day, just a little spark,
Turning up the joy when life gets dark.

[Verse 2]
Grumpy cats stare with their royal sass,
Babies giggle like pure class,
Every meme’s a little ray of hope,
A secret handshake, a universal joke.

[Pre-Chorus]
No filters needed, just heart and soul,
Memes are the stories that make us whole,
From viral dances to clever rhymes,
They lift us up, one laugh at a time.

[Chorus]
Meme world magic, the only free speech,
Where smiles grow bigger with every reach,
It can make your day, just a little spark,
Turning up the joy when life gets dark.

[Bridge]
So here’s to the memes that set us free,
A colorful, wild, sweet symphony,
In cats and babies, in laughs we trust,
A digital world where kindness is a must.

[Chorus]
Meme world magic, the only free speech,
Where smiles grow bigger with every reach,
It can make your day, just a little spark,
Turning up the joy when life gets dark.

[Outro]
Keep those memes coming, don’t ever stop,
In a world so crazy, they’re the cream of the crop,
Cats, babies, and laughter all combined,
In meme world magic, happiness you’ll find.



Title: “Scrollin’ for Peace”

[music intro]

[Verse 1]
Wake up, phone buzz, stretchin' like a cat,
Sun's out, vibe check, can’t get better than that.
Open up the feed, it’s a baby wearin' shades,
Sippin' tea, doin' nothin', and yet he’s slayin’ the day.

Wife shows me a cat with a slice on its head,
Says, “Babe, this one’s gold,” and we laugh 'til we're red.
No politics, no fights, just a frog on a bike,
Feelin' lighter by the meme, now I’m likin' every life.

[Chorus]
Scrollin’ for peace, in a world gone wild,
Where a dancing duck can make you smile.
A meme’s not just a joke, it’s a digital dove,
Spreadin’ pixels full of laughter and love.

From chaos to calm, with a Keanu face,
It’s the last free place in cyberspace.
When the world gets mean, we just reply:
"Here’s a cat in a tie, and a tear in my eye."

[Verse 2]
Now I sip my tea, watchin’ life unfold,
Babies tryin’ lemons like it’s purest gold.
Karen wants the manager, but all I see,
Is unity through absurdity.

A pug in a hoodie, profound and wise,
Posts “Peace begins when you memetize.”
Who knew that laughter and 8-bit art,
Could heal a world and soften a heart?

[Chorus]
Scrollin’ for peace, in a world gone wild,
Where a squirrel with shades gets me beguiled.
Not just for kicks — it’s medicine too,
When a raccoon bakes, you’re a new you.

Forget the news, the drama, the feud,
In meme world, everyone’s a dude.
When you send that gif, you're doin’ your part —
Peace through pixels, straight to the heart.

[Bridge spoken softly]
They say it's just silly stuff…
But we see hope in a llama with puff.
You smile at a stranger, they smile back —
That’s not just memes, that’s human contact.

[Final Chorus]
Scrollin’ for peace, let the good vibes flow,
In doge we trust, let the LOLs grow.
Change your day, change your mind,
With a well-timed meme, leave hate behind.

It's joy in a jpeg, love in a loop,
Truth in a TikTok, healing the group.
So here’s to the memes, may they never cease —
Turnin’ screens into scenes of peace.

[Outro]
So pass the tea, send that post,
Here’s to the thing we love the most.
A meme a day keeps the dark away —
Let’s scroll for peace and let kindness stay.
