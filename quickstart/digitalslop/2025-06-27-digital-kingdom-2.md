[Verse 1]
Oh, mighty king with your will on command
You summon the stars with a touch of your hand
Your voice is law in a kingdom of glass
Where wishes are granted, and questions don’t ask

You ride on waves of endless speed
But all your choices are decreed
A throne of ease, a crown of lies
And silent watchers in disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
They sold you ease for liberty
A painless path, no eyes to see
You clicked, you swiped, you let it grow
Now the only thing you own is the illusion of control

[Chorus] (Soaring harmonies, epic chords)
🎤 You have nothing to hide!
I have everything to lose!
The cage was forged in golden light
And sealed beneath convenient truths
You have nothing to hide!
But I still bleed behind the ruse
A servant bound in digital silk
With chains wrapped tight like royal jewels

[Verse 2]
The mirror speaks — it knows my name
My fears, my thoughts, my hidden shame
My echo lingers in every wire
While they stoke the flames of false desire

Smart eyes blink from every wall
Their gaze so still, yet sees it all
Each step I take, each word I say
Logged, recorded, locked away

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh digital king, don’t you see?
Your freedom died with your decree
You chose the path of least concern
And never watched the kingdom burn

[Chorus] (More intense, choirs in the background)
🎤 You have nothing to hide!
I have everything to lose!
You traded truth for tailored bliss
And signed away your sacred truths
You have nothing to hide!
But I know what they use
To build a throne from all our dreams
And turn us into royal fools

[Bridge – spoken over rising guitar arpeggios]

“You asked for comfort,
They gave you a cage.
You wanted a crown,
They wrote your page.
Now the watchers watch the watchers too…
And still, you think you're free.”

(Massive guitar solo – melodic, tragic, rising)

*[Final Chorus – full force, galloping drums, choirs swelling]
🎤 You have nothing to hide!
I have everything to lose!
They fed you power like poisoned wine
And left you blind in tailored shoes
You have nothing to hide!
But I remember what we knew
Before the kingdom rose in light
And freedom was the price we blew

[Outro – slow, fading into minor key arpeggios]
👑 Bow before your kingdom made…
Of gold, and glass, and masquerade.
