🎵 Title: "Junk Food Love"

[Verse 1]
You click the screen, I light it up
Smile so wide like I’m in love
You say you feel like you know me
But baby, I don’t even know me

I tell my secrets, shed a tear
You feel like I’m whispering in your ear
But every word is polished gold
For views, for likes, for stories sold

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain’t a two-way street we’re on
It’s edited, scripted, and turned on
But still you chase a ghost in gloss
A pretty lie, at your own cost

[Chorus]
"I love you," I say through the screen
Like a candy-coated daydream
But love don't come in sponsored bursts
You want my heart? Pay me first
You’re eating junk food love again
Feels sweet, but it won’t nourish a friend
I’d say your name, give you the world…
If I knew it — but I don’t, so scroll, girl

[Verse 2]
You leave a comment, pour your soul
I heart it fast, I play the role
You say I'm there when you’re alone
But this is pixels, not a home

I’m just a mirror on your phone
Reflecting what you wish was known
And every “you’re my everything”
Feeds the monster behind the ring light beam

[Pre-Chorus]
I sell connection, slice it neat
A hundred smiles, then rinse, repeat
But love, it dies where money grows
You can’t hug a video

[Chorus]
"I love you," I say through the screen
Like a candy-coated daydream
But love don't come in sponsored bursts
You want my heart? Pay me first
You’re eating junk food love again
Feels sweet, but it won’t nourish a friend
I’d say your name, give you the world…
If I knew it — but I don’t, so scroll, girl

[Bridge]
And maybe it feels real tonight
In the blue glow of your bedside light
But I’m not yours, and you’re not mine
We’re just pretending, one view at a time

[Chorus – Final]
"I love you," I sing through the haze
With a brand deal tucked in every phrase
But real hearts don’t come with merch
Wanna feel close? Pay me first
You’re eating junk food love again
It fills the void but leaves you thin
I’d hold your hand, know your name...
But I don’t — and that’s the game

[Outro]
This is fake love, this is screen-deep
You can’t find warmth in something cheap
I love you...
(But only on release week)
