(Power Metal / Synth-Infused – Fast, Melodic, Mechanical Epic)

[Verse 1]
Command accepted — your will obeyed
Each click a law the code has made
A thousand screens, a world on call
You feel like king — but you're nothing at all

The ads align with every breath
They track your dreams, they sell your death
Devices hum, the walls can hear
The price of ease is crystal clear

[Pre-Chorus]
Cloud-born crown on a hollow head
A monarch fed, but blindly led
You gave control, you called it grace
But now you serve the interface

[Chorus – soaring, mechanical, epic]
🎤 You have nothing to hide!
I have everything to lose!
Your throne is built on data chains
And traded truth for tailored views
You have nothing to hide!
But I won’t bow to silent rules
The cage is gold, the doors are wide —
But only kings obey their tools

[Verse 2]
Firewall flames behind your eyes
Your life compressed, your fears digitized
The feed knows all, the feed will say:
“This is what the kings all craved”

The smart glass sees, the echo speaks
Each thought you have — already leaked
No blood, no war, no tyrant's fist
Just code that writes what can’t exist

[Pre-Chorus]
Oblivious lords in zeroed chains
Their freedom sold for minor gains
The trade was ease, the cost was will
Now freedom sleeps on windowsills

[Chorus – stronger, with choral backing]
🎤 You have nothing to hide!
I have everything to lose!
You begged the code to take your weight
And now it walks inside your shoes
You have nothing to hide!
But I still scream behind the fuse
The system listens, still it smiles —
While kings forget what they once knew

[Bridge – robotic spoken word over pulsing synths and galloping drums]

    “You ruled from touchscreens,
    But never ruled yourself.
    You worshipped ease…
    And called it freedom.”

(Shredding solo over digitized arpeggios — part heroic, part tragic)

*[Final Chorus – full band, orchestra synths, harmonic vocals]
🎤 You have nothing to hide!
I have everything to lose!
You live inside a mirror hall
And call the echo pure and true
You have nothing to hide!
But now your soul is just a tool
The price of kingship was your chain —
And silence was the final rule

[Outro – fading with ambient synths and fading electric guitar harmonics]
👑 You touched the world with every breath...
...And gave away what made you real.
