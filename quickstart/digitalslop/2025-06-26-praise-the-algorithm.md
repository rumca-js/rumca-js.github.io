[Verse 1]
Look at the world we live in
Split, and divided
How did we end up here?
Everyone’s got knives behind their words
The aggression—scrolling
Smartphone obsession
Eyes locked, souls offloaded into servers

[Verse 2]
Billionaires siphon your data
Cling to you like leeches
Selling pieces of your life
To the highest bidder,
With a smile that says,
“We’re here to help.”

[Pre-Chorus]
They capture your gaze,
Flood your feed
Fight fake news
While feeding dishonesty

[Chorus]
Praise the algorithm
The power to seduce
Praise the algorithm
The bias, the white glove abuse
Praise the algorithm
It learns what makes you tick
And serves it cold,
So clean, so slick

[Verse 3]
They judge you from digital towers
Corrupted to the core
Extract your age, your fears, your doubts
To sell you what you didn't ask for
Ads targeted like arrows
Straight to the wound

[Pre-Chorus]
Your mind’s a market
Your habits a prize
You scroll through the lie
As your spirit digitizes

[Chorus]
Praise the algorithm
The power to seduce
Praise the algorithm
The bias, the white glove abuse
Praise the algorithm
Your freedom now a trend
The feed goes on
But where does it end?

[Bridge]
You thought you were in control
But the script was written long ago
Every like, every pause
Becomes a line of code
And you,
You’re just the user

[Final Chorus]
Praise the algorithm
Your new divine
Praise the algorithm
The god behind the timeline
Praise the algorithm
Worship while it feeds
On your wants, your fears,
And your scrolling needs
