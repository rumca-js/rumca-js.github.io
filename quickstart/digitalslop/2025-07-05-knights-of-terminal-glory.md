write a folk metal song:
 - about knights of terminal fighting for glory
 - they duel to see who is stronger
 - they wield mighty shields of "bash"
 - swords terminal command attacks create sparks of bits and bytes

“Knights of Terminal Glory”

Genre: Folk Metal / Digital Medieval Fusion
Vocal style: Mix of clean heroic vocals and harsh battle cries
Instruments: Electric guitars, war drums, fiddle, tin whistle, synth accents

[Intro – Fiddle & War Drum Rhythm]

[Spoken, with rising drums and a folk melody building]

    "In the realm of electron fire,
    Where banners wave in command-line spires…
    The knights awaken."

[Verse I – Galloping Folk Rhythm]

From deep within the sacred code,
They ride on bytes through data roads.
Steel-eyed, wrapped in circuit light,
They march to prove their strength in fight!

With chainmail forged of zeroes, ones,
They duel beneath electric suns.
Their shields are lines of brutal bash,
Their blades strike swift in stdout clash!

[Chorus – Heroic and Triumphant]

Hail to the Knights of Terminal Glory!
Dueling in scripts, their never-ending story!
With sparks of bits and short byte,
They clash through entire cyber night!
Raise your shields! Let bash commands ring!
For only the stronger wears the crown of kings!

[Verse II – Slightly Slower, Dramatic]

Through forests made of ribbon wires,
They ride with ancient, blazing priors.
Each line they type, a warrior’s creed—
Each function call, a righteous deed.

The terminals blaze in light mode halls,
With echoes loud in echo calls.
Each knight a coder, bold and proud,
Their battle cries in keystrokes loud!

[Bridge – Flute Melody, Spoken Interlude]

    “--sudo fate—access denied…
    Who shall root the throne tonight?”

[Chanted in chorus]

    grep your honor! kill your shame!
    Only one shall win the game!

[Solo – Fiddle Duel with Guitar / Trading Riffs]

[Fiddle and guitar trade off like dueling knights, building intensity toward final chorus]

[Final Chorus – Modulated, Huge Group Vocals]

Hail to the Knights of Terminal Glory!
Each clash a tale, each loss a story!
From scripts they rise, through sparks and flame,
To carve in code eternal name!
Raise your shields! Let bash commands sing!
For glory waits at the root of the king!
[Outro – Soft Tin Whistle, Fading Keyboard Echo]

[Whispered]

    “In silence now their blades are still…
    Yet their code runs on... eternal will.”
