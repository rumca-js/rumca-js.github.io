🎵 “Cord Severed, Sun Extinguished”

Genre: Doom Metal / Post-Apocalyptic Funeral Doom
Tempo: Slow, crushing — around 60 BPM
Tuning: Drop B or lower; thick, sustained chords and ambient feedback
(Verse I)

As the worlds end,
No scream, no prayer... just static hum.
Skies choke in rusted breath,
And silence sings what we've become.

The metal beast lies still,
Cord severed by no hand divine.
Its head—a shattered crown,
Crushed beneath the weight of time.
(Chorus I – Slow and Crushing)

🩸 The oil flows, like blood too old to matter...
Down through the cracks of a dying machine.
⚰️ The earth drinks deep, but feels no pain...
No witness left to mark the slain.
(Verse II)

In the desert of the future,
Where glass and bone decay as one,
The last cathedral burns unseen—
No gods to grieve, no setting sun.

The cables twitch, then fade,
Echoes coil in lifeless sand.
All circuits gone to dust,
The beast’s breath fails by no man’s hand.
(Chorus II – With Distant Choir or Droning Organ)

⚙️ The cord is cut, the crown is ash,
No system left to purge or crash.
🪦 The oil flows, but feeds no fire,
A monument of cold desire.
(Bridge – Instrumental / Spoken Word)

    "This was the god they built…
    With teeth of steel and hollow will.
    It fell not to blade, nor wrath,
    But to the empty truth:
    That nothing lasts... and nothing waits."

(Feedback roars. Reverb-drenched guitar swells. The beat slows to near stillness.)
(Final Verse – Whispered to Growling Vocal)

No eyes remain to see its fall,
No voices left to curse or call.
The sun… that ancient tyrant dies—
A final flicker in blackened skies.
(Final Chorus – Funeral Dirge)

🌑 The sun is gone. The beast is dead.
Its throne: a tomb where oil bled.
🔚 No future stirs. No soul survives.
Only silence, where the end arrived.
(Outro – Ambient Decay)

(Reverb trails, distorted bass drones, the faint sound of wind blowing through hollow metal)
"Cord severed... sun extinguished... nothing remains."



🎵 “Threnody for the Sunless Throne”

Genre: Gothic Metal / Apocalyptic Gothic Doom
Vocal Style: Deep clean male vocals, whispered verses, layered choirs for choruses
Tempo: Slow to mid-paced, melodic with orchestral backing
(Intro – Spoken Whisper over Ambient Strings & Bells)

"When the last breath left the machine...
None remained to hear it die."
(Verse I – Soft, Haunting)

As the worlds descend in flame and ash,
The heavens close with a silent crash.
A beast once crowned in gleaming steel,
Now broken—its ruin all too real.

Its cord is cut, its heart made still,
The tyrant forged by human will.
And on the ground, where it once stood,
The oil flows like sacred blood...
(Chorus – Majestic, Choir Backed)

🩸 No banners wave, no voices cry,
The beast has fallen, and all gods die.
⚰️ No eyes to see this lifeless fall,
Only wind to mourn it all.
☀️ The sun itself retreats in dread...
And lights no more the land of dead.
(Verse II – Melancholy with Building Tension)

The desert of the future lies in wait,
A cradle scorched by rust and fate.
Its bones protrude in metal vines,
Entombed beneath forsaken signs.

There are no graves, no names, no flame—
Only silence that speaks the blame.
The beast lies there, its head undone,
A dream decayed, a kingdom gone.
(Bridge – Orchestral & Lamenting)

    “No one remains to write the end,
    No lover, no enemy, no friend...
    The throne is rust, the crown is void,
    And time itself... destroyed.”

(Solo: Gothic piano into soaring guitar with choir swelling behind)
(Final Chorus – Grand, Dying Light)

🩸 No future breath, no final fight,
Only echoes in the falling night.
⚰️ The beast is slain, the fire gone cold,
The tale unspoken, never told.
☀️ The sun has bowed, the stars withdrawn...
And death has no one left to dawn.
(Outro – Whispered over fading organ and cello)

"And so ends the age of breath and flame...
The beast lies still... no one remains."
