[Verse 1]
Woke up, logged in — face scan at the gate
Every click tracked, every word holds weight
Gotta enter ID just to check the feed
They want blood type, birth sign, favorite breed

Used to roam free, now it's all on file
They check your DNA when you post a smile
Phone linked to bank, bank linked to name
Name tied to thoughts — it's a rigged-up game

Drop a “like” on the wrong damn post
Get a knock at the door like you’ve seen a ghost
Said a joke on a meme? That’s ten years time
Now sarcasm's a federal crime

[Hook – Chant-style with vocal layering]
🎵 Big Brother got a brand new screen
Barcode dreams, surveillance gleam
Terms & conditions, cage in disguise
Now they fine you for truth and jail you for lies
Digital chains, invisible thugs
No more dirt roads, no more drugs
We ain’t free — we just scanned in place
One wrong emoji, they erase your face 🎵

[Verse 2]
Can't leave a review without signing a form
Say the soup's cold? They’ll call that a storm
AI judge in a courtroom stream
Convicted in minutes for "low self-esteem"

Digital dollars, they know where it goes
Trackin' your snacks and your doctor’s nose
Try to hustle cash? That’s ancient news
Now corner boys trade in compliance views

Cameras blink where the children play
Drone in the sky countin' every stray
City got eyes, sidewalk got ears
Your secrets scream through the vending machines

[Hook – Add crowd chant energy]
🎵 Big Brother got a brand new screen
Barcode dreams, surveillance gleam
Terms & conditions, cage in disguise
Now they fine you for truth and jail you for lies
Digital chains, invisible thugs
No more dirt roads, no more drugs
We ain’t free — we just scanned in place
One wrong emoji, they erase your face 🎵

[Bridge – Slower, eerie instrumental under whispered bars]
Nowhere to hide, no place to run
Every block got a laser gun
Facial match in 0.2
They know your fears better than you

This ain’t the future — it’s already here
Freedom traded for comfort and fear
Say "it’s fine" while they tighten the noose
A smart prison with terms of use

[Final Verse – Spoken, intense delivery]
This is for the ones with no data plans
Payin’ with sweat, livin’ off banned brands
Who remembers life before the click?
Before every choice was a profile pic

We were thugs, poets, rebels and saints
Now we file taxes just to show restraint
The new hustle? Stayin' silent online
But even that silence gets fined

[Final Hook – Reprise with heavier drums]
🎵 Big Brother got a brand new screen
Barcode dreams, surveillance gleam
Terms & conditions, cage in disguise
Now they fine you for truth and jail you for lies
Digital chains, invisible thugs
No more dirt roads, no more drugs
We ain’t free — we just scanned in place
One wrong emoji… they erase your face 🎵

[Outro – Fade out with sample: “Do you agree to the terms?” click]
