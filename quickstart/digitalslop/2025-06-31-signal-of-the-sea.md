🎶 “The Signal and the Sea”
Slow folk ballad in D minor — fingerpicked guitar, haunting fiddle

[Verse 1]
The sun lays warm on my shoulders bare,
As I walk where the pine trees bend.
The wind it moves like a lover's hand,
And the waves come soft round the bend.
Salt on my lips, moss at my feet,
A hush that could carry me home—
But there's a fire in my pocket that flickers and hums,
And it tells me I'm not alone.

[Chorus]
Oh, the woods they whisper peace to me,
And the sea sings wild and free,
But there's a hunger that pulls like a river tide—
A screen in the dark that sees.
I feel the earth, I taste the wind,
But still I ache to know…
Who's liked, who's seen, who’s burning, who's gone—
In a world I cannot hold.

[Verse 2]
A crow calls high from a cedar limb,
And my breath slows deep and wide.
There’s magic here that the news won’t print,
No banner, no war to divide.
But the heat in my chest, it rises fast,
At the thought of a glowing name—
A message missed, a thread unread,
And I feel that old, sweet flame.

[Chorus]
Oh, the woods they whisper peace to me,
And the sea sings wild and free,
But there's a hunger that pulls like a river tide—
A screen in the dark that sees.
I feel the earth, I taste the wind,
But still I ache to know…
Who's rising, who's ruined, who’s speaking my name—
In a world I cannot hold.

[Bridge]
There’s a love in the sun that asks nothing back,
And the breeze doesn’t care where I've been.
But my fingers still twitch with a phantom spark—
A tap, a swipe, a sin.

[Final Verse]
So I walk on through the quiet green,
Where the signal’s weak and slow.
But the ache in my chest is bittersweet—
It’s the cost of letting go.
For all the light that lives in glass,
There’s a shadow it doesn’t show…
The warmth of the wind, the breath of the pines,
And a world I used to know.

[Outro – whispered or soft harmony]
Oh the sea, she sings without a screen,
But my heart is torn in two…
One half in waves, one lost in names,
Still waiting to break through.
