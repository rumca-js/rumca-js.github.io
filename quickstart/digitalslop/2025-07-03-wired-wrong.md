🎵 Title: “Wired Wrong”

Produced in a gritty, haunting boom-bap style with eerie ambient samples, chopped up analog static, and warped piano loops.

[Intro – Spoken Word Over Static]

    “The Industrial Revolution and its consequences...
    Have been a disaster for the human race.”

[Verse 1]
Born in the books, prodigy with the math tricks
Mind sharp like he carved thoughts with a hatchet
Skipped grades, lost touch, pressure from the atlas
Society cracked him — broke down the axis

Cabin in the woods, off-grid no wires
Felt the whole world burn, but he never saw fire
Just letters in the post, bombs wrapped in a lie
Manifesto in his chest, sayin' mankind gotta die

No screens, no strings, no digital leash
Said tech made men slaves, just fed 'em deceit
A system so wide, they don’t even need police
When every man’s a product of the code underneath

He wrote in the dark, with the forest as his chapel
No trust in machines, no man as his vassal
The blueprint of hell disguised as advancement
He fought with fire, but bred only madness

[Hook]
Wired wrong, yeah the whole world’s glitchin’
System’s a god now, got us all twitchin’
Plugged into pain, screen’s the new religion
Ted saw the prison, but chose demolition

We build what we fear, then praise it to death
Trade off our minds just to chase what’s next
No one questions, just tap and obey
But Ted burned bridges 'cause he couldn’t look away

[Verse 2]
He watched towers rise, and towers fall
Said “Freedom’s an illusion, the cage just got tall”
Laws written in silence, choice pre-installed
Every “yes” just a no wrapped up in a call

Thought he’d be a savior, prophet of the wild
But terror ain’t truth when it murders a child
He raged at the gears, tried to grind down the age
But ended in a cell, scrawlin’ fury on a page

Paranoia was the lens, and he saw too much
But knowing the sickness don’t excuse the cuts
He warned us of the beast, yeah, the system that grows
But became what he hated just to balance the code

Now we scroll and we swipe, every second's a trade
No bombs in the box, but we're all gettin' played
Addicted to the updates, blind in the wave
And the forest is quiet — just his name on the grave

[Hook – Repeat]
Wired wrong, yeah the whole world’s glitchin’
System’s a god now, got us all twitchin’
Plugged into pain, screen’s the new religion
Ted saw the prison, but chose demolition

We build what we fear, then praise it to death
Trade off our minds just to chase what’s next
No one questions, just tap and obey
But Ted burned bridges 'cause he couldn’t look away

[Outro – Whispered Over Echoing Static]

    “You cannot reform this.
    You can only dismantle it...
    Or be swallowed whole.”
