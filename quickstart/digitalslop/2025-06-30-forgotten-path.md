Write me a rock ballad:
 - written from perspective of devil
 - it is monologue towards god
 - he shows how Christians failed
 - how they sin
 - how much they are hypocrites
 - the lack of faith, uncesrtainity
 - he juxtapositions it against first christians who died for faith, missionaries, churches were full, knights were fighting for belief
 - now churches are empty
 - no new priests
 - there seems to be no road ahead of christianity

"Empty Pews and Broken Oaths"
rock ballad

(Slow, haunting electric guitar intro)

[Verse 1]
I watch your children stumble blind,
Once fire in their eyes, now lost in time,
They speak Your name but shun Your ways,
Whisper prayers, then drift away.

Saints who bled beneath the cross,
Martyrs' blood, now just a ghost,
Temples full, their voices loud â€”
Now silence falls beneath the shroud.

[Chorus]
Where are the knights who bled for truth?
Where are the shepherds, preaching proof?
Empty pews, no candles lit,
Faith undone, the holy writ.

They wear their masks of pious lies,
Cast stones with bitter alibis,
Hypocrites in Your holy name,
Playing sinners, hiding shame.

[Verse 2]
First they burned for You with hearts aflame,
Now they doubt, and I reclaim â€”
The souls who once marched brave and tall,
Now slip and fall in shadowsâ€™ thrall.

Missionaries crossed the seas,
Fought for grace and memories,
Now no footsteps in the dust,
No priests rising, no sacred trust.

[Chorus]
Where are the knights who bled for truth?
Where are the shepherds, preaching proof?
Empty pews, no candles lit,
Faith undone, the holy writ.

They wear their masks of pious lies,
Cast stones with bitter alibis,
Hypocrites in Your holy name,
Playing sinners, hiding shame.

[Bridge]
You gave them light, You gave them love,
But now they turn their eyes above â€”
To comfort, doubt, and empty space,
A hollow, fading, faithless race.

No road ahead, no path to take,
Their sacred bond begins to break.
I smile, for their weakness is my gain,
Their silence feeds my endless reign.

[Final Chorus]
Where are the knights who bled for truth?
Where are the shepherds, preaching proof?
Empty pews, no candles lit,
Faith undone, the holy writ.

They wear their masks of pious lies,
Cast stones with bitter alibis,
Hypocrites in Your holy name,
Playing sinners, hiding shame.

[Outro]
So tell me, Lord, where do You stand?
Watching faith slip through Your hand?
Iâ€™m here to claim what theyâ€™ve let fall â€”
Empty pews and broken oaths,
The silence after all.

(Guitar fades into haunting echoes)





Gothic metal ballad

ðŸŽ¼ "The Forgotten Path"

(Intro: Church bells toll. Deep organ swells. Wind howls faintly. A lone whisperâ€¦)
"Et veritas non fugit... sed homines fugiunt."
(The truth does not fleeâ€¦ but mankind does.)

[Verse 1 â€“ low clean baritone, sparse echoing guitars]

I watched them stray from sacred light,
Their hands once raised, now clenched in spite.
You gave them truth, You lit the flame,
They let it die, and cursed Your name.

They built their shrines with blood and stone,
Now pray to mirrors, not the throne.
The path was clear, the words were pure â€”
But comfort made them insecure.

[Pre-Chorus â€“ melodic female backing, angelic tone]

Where are the voices that would not bend?
The saints who'd die before they sinned?
You gave them roads, they turned away â€”
Now I walk where faith decays.

[Chorus â€“ layered growl + clean harmony]

This is not Your failure, Lord â€”
They heard Your call, then dropped the sword.
The churches echo with the past,
No priests remain, no shadows cast.

They fear the truth they claim to seek,
Their hearts are proud, their spirits weak.
The path was there â€” the light was shown â€”
But they chose silence over stone.

[Verse 2 â€“ slow spoken-word building into melody]

Remember them? The ones who burned?
Who faced the lions, never turned?
They bled with joy for just Your name â€”
Now sermons fade, and none remain.

No missionaries cross the tide,
No knights with banners at their side.
Just vacant halls and fading creeds,
A garden choked by selfish weeds.

[Bridge â€“ whispered growl over choral harmony]

I did not blind themâ€¦ I did not leadâ€¦
They wandered, God â€” they chose their need.
The cross still stands, the truth still speaksâ€¦
But nowâ€¦ Your flockâ€¦ is tired and weak.

[Final Chorus â€“ slow, mournful, orchestral backing]

This is not Your failure, Lord â€”
You gave them light, they dropped the sword.
Empty pews and fading songs,
The faithful sleepâ€¦ it wonâ€™t be long.

No saints arise, no prophets cry,
Just hollow faith beneath the sky.
They had the road, the flame, the breath â€”
But traded gloryâ€¦ for quiet death.

[Final Outro â€“ Spoken Latin over organ and ambient decay]

    Expectavit Dominusâ€¦ sed nemo venit.
    (The Lord waitedâ€¦ but no one came.)

    Vox clamantis in desertoâ€¦ siluit.
    (The voice crying in the wildernessâ€¦ fell silent.)

    Fides dormivit. Lux arsitâ€¦ et exspiravit.
    (Faith slept. The light burnedâ€¦ and expired.)

    Et itaâ€¦ regno non per doloâ€¦ sed per absentiam.
    (And soâ€¦ I reign not by deceitâ€¦ but by absence.)

    (The organ fades. Wind whispers. Silence returns.)
