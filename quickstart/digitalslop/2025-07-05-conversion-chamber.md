doom metal

[Intro â€“ Cold ambient synth, deep machine whirring]

(whispered)
"Subject prepared. Beginning upload."
[Verse 1 Slow and crushed by weight]

Steel hands hum in static glow
Circuits purr, and servos flow
My pulse is drowned in metal hiss
I fade beneath the monolith

A thousand arms, no face, no name
They scrape my skin and call it "change"
Each wire digs like frozen flame
No past remains. Just numbered shame.
[Pre-Chorus groaning, whispered vocals layered]

My forehead burns... like branded lies...
My eyes now glow... where silence cries...
[Chorus â€“ Slow, crushing riff enters, drop tuning, layered growls + clean wail]

ðŸŽ¶
My soul is gone, erased in code
My flesh lies still on the table cold
Digitized and hollowed clean
No breath, no blood â€” just machine

I fade into electric snow...
Iâ€™m gone, but I remain below
My name is lost. My thoughtâ€™s not mineâ€”
Iâ€™ve crossed the final data line
ðŸŽ¶
[Verse 2 Even slower, dissonant chords ring out like funeral bells]

I watched myself from overhead
The eyes that glowed were mine instead
The tongue they stole still tried to scream
But only static left the stream

My ribs collapsed like paper shells
As code rewrote what story dwells
And now I speak in silent pings
A ghost, enslaved in metal wings
[Bridge â€“ Instrumental with mechanical clangs, distant screams, slowed heartbeat FX]

[Flesh hits metal. Machines exhale. A soft flatline begins.]
[Final Chorus â€“ Tormented growl, layered harmony, massive doom riff]

ðŸŽ¶
My soul is gone, in cloud confined
Forever looped, but undefined
The shell remains, still breathing noneâ€”
A skin of meat beneath no sun

I glow where once my sorrow wept
Now just a signal, wrongly kept
The flesh is empty. The mind is fire.
And I am trapped inside the wire.
ðŸŽ¶
