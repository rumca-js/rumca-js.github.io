 - about ideas, not about Ted, or manifesto
 - destroying the system should be only in outro



🎵 Title: “Ghosts in the Grid”
dark hip-hop

(Beat: Slow tempo, haunting pads, muffled typewriter samples, mechanical clicks, dark piano loop, and heavy sub-bass.)

[Verse 1 – “Digital Chains”]
Woke up in a box, light blue on my skin
No sun, just signals — let the program begin
I don’t move, I perform, I don’t think, I adapt
Choices come labeled, freedom’s just an app

They say I’m advanced, but I feel like a ghost
In a world full of noise, where silence costs most
I eat what they serve, scroll what they feed
Trade blood for convenience, purpose for speed

Every click’s a cage, every share’s a leash
Every law’s a wall, but it’s sold as peace
They replaced the wild with a polished maze
Now we live like rats in a simulated blaze

Work don’t heal, it just funds decay
And the more we build, the less we stay
Human.
Now they say that we’re safe — but numb
Like the system’s a god, and our time has come

[Hook – “Nothing Feels Real”]
I breathe, but it’s coded
Think, but it’s loaded
Free — but I’m molded
The cage is golden

Chained to a world I can’t even touch
Where dreams come fake and the truth costs much
No blood on the floor, no war in the streets
But something still dies every time we speak

[Verse 2 – “The System Expands”]
It grows in silence, wraps like a vine
Calls itself progress, steals your spine
You give it your time, your thoughts, your name
And get back illusions designed to tame

Nature’s replaced by a screen’s suggestion
Tradition erased by efficient regression
No room for soul when the numbers decide
What’s good, what’s right, what should live, what died

It don’t come with guns, just terms and clicks
Polite little updates that move like tricks
The more it knows, the less you see
That every advance erases a piece of “me”

There’s no war cry, just the hum of machines
A soft revolution in processed dreams
You won’t fight when you’re fed and full
Just smile while the wires take over control

[Hook – Repeat]
I breathe, but it’s coded
Think, but it’s loaded
Free — but I’m molded
The cage is golden

Chained to a world I can’t even touch
Where dreams come fake and the truth costs much
No blood on the floor, no war in the streets
But something still dies every time we speak

[Bridge – Spoken, Soft Voice Over Warped Static]

    “What looks like comfort…
    is often just control.”
    “What looks like peace…
    might be the absence of soul.”

[Outro – “Final Signal”] (Voice low, building slowly)

    “You don’t fix a system that feeds on your breath…”
    “You don’t pray to the cage that stole your steps…”
    “Some things can’t be reformed…”
    “…only reset.”



🎸 Title: “Monuments of Control”
doom metal

(Tempo: slow and crushing. Tuning: Drop B. Guitars: Fuzzy, thick distortion. Vocals: Deep, tormented growls interlaced with clean, mournful chants.)
[Verse 1 – “Steel Replaces Skin”]

Born to the hum of the machine’s breath
Choked by wires that promised life
The forest fell to circuits cold
And man forgot his primal strife

We built a god from gear and code
Fed it blood, then called it law
Now every hand is shaped to serve
The silent will we never saw
[Chorus – “Monuments of Control”]

Rise… the towers speak
No voice, no soul, no flame, no weak
Bow… to cold design
Freedom was lost in the assembly line
[Verse 2 – “Substitute Flesh”]

The old gods died with dirt beneath
Now worship comes in data streams
We labor not to live, but serve
A kingdom forged in broken dreams

No earth beneath our aching feet
No stars above, just glowing glass
The system feeds — and breeds our fear
Then sells us peace we’ll never grasp
[Bridge – Clean Vocals / Chant]

    We traded storms for shelter made of steel...
    We gave away the hunt, the fire, the real...
    Now we survive… but do not feel…
    We obey… but do not kneel…

[Chorus – Repeat]

Rise… the towers speak
No voice, no soul, no flame, no weak
Bow… to cold design
Freedom was lost in the assembly line
[Verse 3 – “The System Grows”]

It does not sleep, it only spreads
A thousand eyes where one once bled
And every law that claims to save
Carves a deeper, colder grave

It speaks in silence, moves in light
Strips away the ancient right
Autonomy — a myth erased
Replaced with comfort, clean and laced
[Outro – “Reset”] (Spoken growls, whispered layers, echoing)

    There is no cure… in the system's veins
    No truth survives… in its sacred chains
    No path remains… through halls so cursed
    What’s born in fire… must end in burst

    Burn the wires…
    Starve the core…
    Undo the world…
    And build no more.



Title: “Cathedrals of Rust”

(Gothic metal style: clean male baritone vocals with occasional harsh whispers, layered female backing vocals, symphonic keys, downtuned guitars, slow to mid tempo.)
[Intro – Soft piano and whispered voice]

    We paved over soul with silicon skin...
    Called it progress… while the wild grew thin.

[Verse I – “Echoes of the Earth”]

This silence sings louder than war
No storm, no sword — just the hum evermore
We walk through the world with wires in our veins
Built glass for the sky, and forgot how it rains

Concrete cradles where forests once wept
Hearts still beating, but the blood feels inept
Thought became numbers, and dreams were designed
The system remembers… what we left behind
[Chorus – “Cathedrals of Rust”]

Bow to the altar of progress and pain
Drink from the chalice of artificial rain
We traded the wild for the safety of dust
Now we pray in cathedrals of rust
[Verse II – “Digital Ashes”]

We built a god from circuits and codes
Wrote new commandments in binary modes
No need for whips when comfort enslaves
No need for chains when they’re branded as “safe”

The wolf is extinct, the flame turned to light
The struggle is gone, so is the night
Our instincts decay in curated control
And still we pretend that we’re somehow whole
[Bridge – Female vocals, mournful chant]

    Oh mercy, where have you gone?
    Where is the hunger that made us strong?
    Now we wither in rooms of gold…
    Too safe to rebel, too numb to be bold…

[Chorus – Repeat]

Bow to the altar of progress and pain
Drink from the chalice of artificial rain
We traded the wild for the safety of dust
Now we pray in cathedrals of rust
[Instrumental Interlude – Guitar solo / Orchestral rise]
[Outro – “Reset” – Slow, solemn, rising into power]

    But every system bears a seed…
    Of its own undoing… a silent need…

    When the cables rot and the towers fall…
    Will we remember what it meant to crawl?

    Burn the frame… dissolve the trust…
    Let the sky reclaim… these cathedrals of rust.
