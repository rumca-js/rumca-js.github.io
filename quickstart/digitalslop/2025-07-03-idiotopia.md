write a pop song:
 - light hearted
 - that we live in idiocracy
 - we do not have to worry about anything again
 - these are end of times nobody care
 - earth no longer a place to leave, but we chill looking as it melts
 - governments corrupt and we smile at tv
 - we care about youtube drama, reaction videos



“Idiotopia”

[Verse 1]
Wake up, no stress, it’s a crazy world,
But we’re cruising easy, no plans unfurled.
News on the screen? Just a funny show,
Everybody’s chill, and we’re taking it slow.

[Pre-Chorus]
No need to worry, no need to think,
Living life simple, we’re on the brink—
Of a happy mess, but it’s all okay,
We’re riding the wave every single day.

[Chorus]
Welcome to Idiotopia, where the sun always shines,
No brainwaves needed, just good vibes and rhymes.
Forget the drama, forget the pain,
In this silly little world, we don’t have to worry again.

[Verse 2]
Tweets full of nonsense, but who even cares?
We’re dancing in circles, blowing bubbles in air.
No pressure, no deadlines, no serious rules,
Just laughter and freedom, living like fools.

[Pre-Chorus]
No need to worry, no need to think,
Living life simple, we’re on the brink—
Of a happy mess, but it’s all okay,
We’re riding the wave every single day.

[Chorus]
Welcome to Idiotopia, where the sun always shines,
No brainwaves needed, just good vibes and rhymes.
Forget the drama, forget the pain,
In this silly little world, we don’t have to worry again.

[Bridge]
Let’s toast to the chaos, the bliss in the strange,
A little bit clueless, but free from the change.
In Idiotopia, we’re laughing through the rain,
No need to think twice, no stress, no pain.

[Final Choru])
Welcome to Idiotopia, where the sun always shines,
No brainwaves needed, just good vibes and rhymes.
Forget the drama, forget the pain,
In this silly little world, we don’t have to worry again.



🎵 Title: "It's Fine, Everything's Burning"

[Verse 1]
Cheerful skies, but the sea’s on fire
Dancin’ in the heat like it’s babylon empire
Scrollin’ past the floods, got no desire
To change the channel, girl, I’m feelin’ higher

Government's wildin’, sayin’ it’s fine
I just laugh, eat popcorn, sip cheap wine
“Emergency alert!” — ooh, what a line
Right after this makeup haul, I’ll read the signs

[Pre-Chorus]
We got drama, tea, and a brand new feud
Two influencers fightin’ over cam and booze
The world’s in chaos, but we got views
And I ain’t got time for the climate blues

[Chorus]
We’re fine, everything’s burning
But we got memes and the fan base's turning
Reacting to reactors, it’s the end of time
But I’m vibin’ in my room like everything’s divine
Yeah, the earth’s a mess, but we’re still smirking
Smile for the cam while the system’s jerking
Idiots in charge, but I’m not concerned
'Cause we’ve got war, and that’s all we ever earned

[Verse 2]
Used to dream of Mars, now we just vibe
Skateboard past the smoke like, “We’ll survive”
Apathy’s the new way to thrive
Post a pic of the ash cloud — #Alive

Congress sleepin’ while the oceans rise
But we got filters to fix our lives
Kardashians trending, that’s the prize
What’s real news? I just monetize

[Pre-Chorus]
We got hot takes, clout, and fan debates
Tinfoil theories served up on paper plates
Collapse looks good in neon shades
So turn it up and ride this wave

[Chorus]
It's all fine, everything’s burning
But we got memes and the fan base's turning
Reacting to reactors, it’s the end of time
But I’m vibin’ in my room like everything’s divine
Yeah, the earth’s a mess, but we’re still smirking
Smile for the cam while the system’s jerking
Idiots in charge, but I’m not concerned
'Cause we’ve got war, and that’s all we ever earned

[Bridge]
No need to cry, just autotune the pain
We’re all just pixels dancing in the rain
History books will be TikTok chains
And I’ll duet the fall with a smile again

(Final Chorus)
We’re fine, everything’s burning
But we’re too lit to feel the world turning
Reacting to the end, and the vibe is prime
As the cities sink, we just drop another rhyme
Yeah, the earth’s on fire, but we’re still smirking
Smile for the gram while the forests are smirking
Idiots in charge, but I’m not concerned
'Cause we’ve got clout, and that’s all we ever earned

[Outro – spoken]
“Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe... while the oceans boil.”
