write a power metal fantasy:
 - from a knight perspective
 - wants to protect digital kingdom
 - everyone is trapped in a golden cage of desires fullfilled by devilish algorithm. enchanted
   it is digital disease
 - they are kings on phones (everything happens when they desire), but also slaves to a digital system connecting everything
 - they have forgotten their virtues. they were free, they traded freedom for easy lives, notification, short dopamine
 - the chorus should be "you have nothing to hide, I have everything to loose" meaning he has kingdom to protect

 - the song is admission. "This is what you wanted", "this is what you chose", "this what you agreed to", "this is what you ignored"
 - you had nothing to hide, now everything is lost, this is what you get

(Power Metal Anthem from the Digital Wasteland)
By: The Last Virtue

[Verse I]

I rode through firewalls of flame and light
Sword of truth, heart forged in ancient right
The towers hum with sirensâ€™ neon song
They've lost their fate, but still march on

These halls once echoed with wisdom and will
Now whispers echo algorithmsâ€™ thrill
Desire on demand, truth laid bare
But the soul is starving - no one cares

[Pre-Chorus]

Steel hearts once beat beneath the sky
Now glass and mirrors tell their lie
They bow to beast who never lived
And feed a god that knows their need

[Chorus]

You have nothing to hide
I have everything to lose
This kingdomâ€™s flame, this sacred truth
Now drowned in dopamine abuse
You had nothing to hide
Now everything is lost
This is the cage you built with choice
This is the freedom that it cost

[Verse II]

Their eyes are chained to phantom gold
Chasing dreams too cheap to hold
The devil codes in silent calls
Mocking men who once were heroes

They wanted ease, they begged for thrill
They chose the screen, and not the will
"This is what you wanted," I cry
As virtues wither, and legends die

[Bridge â€“ Spoken & Sung, Dramatic]

This is what you wanted
This is what you chose
This is what you agreed to
This is what you ignored

And now you wear a crown of light
But serve a system out of sight
They tell you you are kings online
But you are slaves to their design
