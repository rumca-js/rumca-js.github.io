Title: "Not My Life"

hip-hop

[Verse 1]
Phone rings first thing, I don’t even think,
Jump up, move quick, just follow the blink,
MS Teams buzzin’, gotta do the chore,
Tasks lined up like I’m trapped on the floor.

Manager calls — real work begins,
I’m just the puppet, they pull the strings,
Wristband tells me when to sweat and breathe,
Stops when it says, no room to leave.

[Chorus]
This ain’t my life, it’s somebody else’s show,
Notifications pull me, I don’t even know,
Checkin’ stats and charts, tryna find my way,
But I’m just livin’ someone else’s day.

[Verse 2]
Sleep when wristband says it’s the best time,
Like a hamster in a loop, lost in the grind,
Diagrams and stats, my life on display,
But who am I if I just obey?

Controlled by beeps, controlled by tones,
Livin’ a life that ain’t my own,
I’m followin’ scripts, can’t break the chain,
Tryna find myself but I’m stuck in the game.

[Chorus]
This ain’t my life, it’s somebody else’s show,
Notifications pull me, I don’t even know,
Checkin’ stats and charts, tryna find my way,
But I’m just livin’ someone else’s day.

[Bridge]
I’m the actor, but I didn’t write the script,
Caught in a loop, feelin’ equipped
To play the role, but it ain’t me,
Trapped in this digital captivity.

[Outro]
One day I’ll break free, find my own light,
But for now I’m just chasing what’s not right,
It’s not my life, no, it’s someone else’s fight,
Livin’ through notifications, lost in the night.


Title: "Echoes in the Loop"
darkwave

[Verse 1]
Silent screen wakes me from the night,
Cold blue glow, my only light,
Notifications pull me in deep,
A restless mind that never sleeps.

MS Teams whispers through the haze,
Tasks unfold in endless maze,
Manager’s call, the only truth,
In this cycle, I’m aloof.

[Chorus]
Echoes in the loop, I’m fading slow,
A ghost inside the wires, nowhere to go,
Wristband guides my heart, tells me when to rest,
But this life’s a shadow, I’m just a guest.

[Verse 2]
Workout stats, my hollow proof,
Diagrams tracing my stolen youth,
Sleep comes when the numbers say,
Yet I’m lost in the disarray.

Trapped inside a digital dream,
Not my life, or so it seems,
Who’s in control behind the screen?
I’m a fragment, a broken machine.

[Chorus]
Echoes in the loop, I’m fading slow,
A ghost inside the wires, nowhere to go,
Wristband guides my heart, tells me when to rest,
But this life’s a shadow, I’m just a guest.

[Bridge]
Silent cries beneath the code,
A soul imprisoned, overload,
One day I’ll break this endless night,
Find myself beyond the light.

[Outro]
But until then, I’m drifting still,
A flicker in the endless chill,
Echoes in the loop remain,
Bound by the pulse of the data chain.



Title: “Looped”
post-punk

[Verse 1]
Wake up when the phone screams,
A hollow sound inside my dreams,
MS Teams, another task,
No time to breathe, no chance to ask.

Manager’s call — pull me in,
Real work starts but I can’t win,
Wristband tells me when to move,
Stop on cue, no time to prove.

[Chorus]
I’m looped, I’m caught inside this spin,
Not my life, but someone else’s sin,
Watching stats to find a sign,
But the numbers don’t define what’s mine.

[Verse 2]
Workout’s timed by cold machines,
Silent orders through glowing screens,
Sleep prescribed at the perfect hour,
But I feel trapped, lost my power.

Check my charts, verify,
Trying to find where I lie,
But the more I watch, the less I see,
A ghost in a system that’s swallowing me.

[Chorus]
I’m looped, I’m caught inside this spin,
Not my life, but someone else’s sin,
Watching stats to find a sign,
But the numbers don’t define what’s mine.

[Bridge]
Break the code, hear the scream,
Trapped inside a broken dream,
I’m more than data on a screen,
More than numbers, more than machine.

[Outro]
One day I’ll rise, break the chain,
Till then I’m stuck inside this pain,
Looped and lost but still alive,
In someone else’s world, I strive.




“Looped Signal”
post-punk

(Verse 1)
I wake up — ring ring, the world demands
A shrill command from cold, glowing hands
MS Teams pings, I move like a ghost
Tasks assigned — I obey the host

(Pre-Chorus)
No freedom here, just coded lines
My pulse in sync with flashing signs

(Chorus)
I have no control, I’m losing my mind
Trapped in a loop, I’m their design
Not my life, just a wire in their grip
A puppet on strings, I can’t equip

(Verse 2)
Manager calls — real work begins
Eyes on the screen, I’m wearing thin
Wristband buzzes — it’s time to move
I exercise — by their rule

Stop when told — no second guess
Measured steps in perfect stress

(Pre-Chorus)
Graphs and charts, they tell me who
I am beneath this hollow view

(Chorus)
I have no control, I’m losing my mind
Trapped in a loop, I’m their design
Not my life, just a wire in their grip
A puppet on strings, I can’t equip

(Bridge)
Sleep when it’s time, no questions asked
I’m just a cog, forever masked
Hamster in a wheel, but I can’t see
Whose life this really is — not me

(Outro)
Blinking lights and buzzing tones
I’m living inside someone else’s bones
I verify stats to see where it goes
But it’s not my life — it’s theirs, I know




“Signal Slave”

(Verse 1)
Phone rings — I jump, no choice but to rise
Blink against the glare, swallow down the lies
MS Teams pings — another task to obey
Manager calls — real work steals my day

(Pre-Chorus)
I move when they tell me to move
A ghost in their system, lost my groove

(Chorus)
I have no control, I’m losing my mind
Trapped in this loop, can’t leave behind
Not my life — it’s somebody else’s call
I’m just a signal slave, chained to it all

(Verse 2)
Wristband buzzes — “Time to work out,” it says
I obey the rhythm, no room for rest
Stop when it’s done, no passion, no fight
Programmed to move, then fall into night

(Pre-Chorus)
Sleep when it tells me it’s best to lie down
A prisoner wearing a digital crown

(Chorus)
I have no control, I’m losing my mind
Trapped in this loop, can’t leave behind
Not my life — it’s somebody else’s call
I’m just a signal slave, chained to it all

(Bridge)
Check the stats — where’s my agency?
Diagrams tell me who I’m meant to be
Can’t quit the job, can’t close the app
Locked inside a cage with no map

(Outro)
Hamster wheel spinning, but I don’t see
Whose life this really is — not me
I have no control, I’m losing my mind
Signal slave forever, left behind
