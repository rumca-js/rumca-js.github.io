"Connect the Dots"

Verse 1:
Neon lights, electric skies
Signals flash, no disguise
Through the wires, through the streams
I can connect with you in dreams

Chorus:
Platforms light the way tonight
Binary hearts in pixel flight
I can connect, I can relate
In this digital state, we communicate

Verse 2:
Code and waves, we intertwine
Across the grid, your pulse is mine
Silent data, whispered calls
Platforms break the lonely walls

Chorus:
Platforms light the way tonight
Binary hearts in pixel flight
I can connect, I can relate
In this digital state, we communicate

Bridge (Instrumental synth/keygen solo)

Outro:
In the stream, we come alive
Connected souls will always thrive
