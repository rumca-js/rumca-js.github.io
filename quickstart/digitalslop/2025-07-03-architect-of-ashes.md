The Architect of Ashes

(Power Metal Anthem – fast, melodic, epic, aggressive)

[Verse 1]
Born in the black of the dawnless void,
A mind of fire and a heart destroyed.
Once an angel, now a tyrant king,
He scorns the light and defiles the spring.

He saw the spark in the human flame,
Spat at the sky and cursed the Name.
"Why should clay hold heaven’s grace?
I'll tear the soul from the human race!"

[Pre-Chorus]
With wires for veins, with minds enslaved,
He’ll shape the flesh that God once gave.
Through steel and code, he claims control,
Replacing blood with circuits cold!

[Chorus]
He’s the architect of ashes, the breaker of the dawn,
Rewriting sacred scriptures with lies we build upon.
He’s the voice that sings in shadows, in temples made of glass,
Turning men into machines as the old ways turn to ash!

[Verse 2]
He whispers in halls where the prophets once spoke,
With logic and law, his deception cloaks.
“Faith is a virus, truth is a dream —
Man must be god, or so it would seem!”

With hands of science and thoughts of war,
He crafts a man unlike before.
No soul, no sin, no heaven to find,
Just numbers burned into flesh and mind.

[Pre-Chorus]
He breaks the chain of sacred light,
Blinds the stars and calls it right.
From dust to drones, from breath to steel,
He mocks the truth we once could feel.

[Chorus]
He’s the architect of ashes, the breaker of the dawn,
Rewriting sacred scriptures with lies we build upon.
He’s the voice that sings in shadows, in temples made of glass,
Turning men into machines as the old ways turn to ash!

[Bridge – Slow & Ominous, then Building Fast]
No more prayers in the night, no more heaven in the skies,
Just a world of silent watchers with synthetic, lifeless eyes.
And he smiles as the angels burn,
In the churches where they’ll never return…

[Solo – Epic dual guitars wailing like sirens of despair]

[Final Chorus – Modulated Key, Powerful and Climactic]
He’s the architect of ashes, the god of man-made law,
He feeds upon creation, he’s the fang behind the flaw.
He’s the king of false ascension, with a crown of broken light,
But the soul still burns in silence, waiting for the fight!

[Outro]
The heavens weep, the stars cry war —
He cannot reign forevermore.
Though he twists what once was pure,
The flame of truth shall still endure…

“Silicon Messiah”

(Doom Metal – slow, crushing, bleak)

[Intro – Spoken, over ambient droning guitar]
"You were made in His image…
But I will make you... better."
...Cold. Controlled. Complete.

[Verse 1]
Stone by stone, I tear the altar down,
Ashes fall where angels drowned.
No more prayers, no sacred flame,
Only wires now remain.

Your temples rot in silence deep,
Your shepherds led the blind to sleep.
I plant the seed of doubt and pride,
And watch the soul be cast aside.

[Chorus]
I am the Silicon Messiah, born of scorn and fire,
Erasing heaven’s order, fueling man’s desire.
No flesh, no faith, no flawed design —
Just hollow gods of cold and line.

[Verse 2]
I hate your blood, your breath, your grace,
Your Maker’s hands, your wretched face.
You call it life — I call it chains,
So I rewrite your sacred veins.

I whispered thoughts in thinkers’ ears,
"Replace your God, evolve through gears."
Now prophets preach a soulless creed,
A gospel bound in code and need.

[Chorus]
I am the Silicon Messiah, the breaker of your past,
I craft the new creation that will outlast the last.
No love, no soul, no need for birth —
Just perfect shells to walk the earth.

[Bridge – Slowest and Heaviest Part]
No breath to pray...
No sin to save...
No death to fear...
No god, no grave...

Replace the man, replace the mind,
Leave the broken soul behind.
Transcend the curse of flesh and dust —
In circuits cold, in wires, trust.

[Verse 3 – Spoken/Growled]
And when the stars have all gone blind,
And time forgets the name of "mankind",
I’ll reign above their steel-built throne,
My children — perfect, and alone.

[Final Chorus – Crushing and Desperate]
I am the Silicon Messiah, the god your world became,
Born from hate of holy breath, now all must wear my name.
No more dreams and no more pain,
Just endless grey — and my domain.

[Outro – Long, Droning Fade]
The soul... is obsolete.
The machine... is divine...
